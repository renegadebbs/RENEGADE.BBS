I don't know if anybody's interested in this, but i made a sort of hack
protocol using a batchfile and winrar.

what it allows you to do is compress and send your files WITH long filenames to your user.
it will also retain directory structure [or change it so it doesnt] so said files
are organized how your personal file areas are.

example:
#  Archive D:\bbs\TEMP\FILES78.rar
2009-11-18 12:14             7             7  BBS\BBSFILES\HPVAC\testfile.txt
#
# Total                   Size        Packed  Files
#                            7             7  1


It creates a temporary .rar file using  files(user numer_.RAR and then
sends it via fdsz [or any fossil protocol you'd care to add to the batchfile)

I'm really satisified with it, and the bonus is users get long file names and their
files are sorted.
