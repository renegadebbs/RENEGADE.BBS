 Foreword - Upgrading, Version Numbers, and what is Renegade anyway?
&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

  &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;
  What is Renegade?
  &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

    Renegade BBS is a bulletin board software derived from the Telegard BBS
v2.5g source code. Telegard is in turn a modified version of the WWIV pascal
source code. Renegade, however has been vastly improved from the original
TG 2.5g source.

    Changes can be browsed from a file known as WHATDONE which list the
hundreds of changes made to the original code. Renegade offers SysOps the
ultimate in BBS configuration, allowing your BBS to achieve a UNIQUE look and
feel.

    Renegade was originally written by Cott Lang. It is currently authored
by Patrick Spence and Gary Hall.
 
    Renegade is a Beta test BBS software. In the past, there were clamors for
registration, but there is no way to register the software per se. The
authors ask that you donate $25 for the use of the software. In return, you
are provided with an account on either of their boards and direct support.

Renegade uses the SPAWNO routines by Ralf Brown to minimize memory use while
shelling to DOS and running other programs.

  &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;
  A Note On Version Numbers
  &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

     Some of you are probably noticing the change in Renegade's version
numbers. 5-11-96 Exp was the last release using the date for the version.
After 5-11 Exp, Patrick Spence took over production of Renegade and changed
the version numbers to the following format:

                              vyr-day.b os

yr  - Year in which this version was released
day - The Julian Date the version was released
b   - Either b or a, depending on type. Indicates
      Beta copy or Alpha copy, respectively
os  - Native Operating system

     For example, v96-300b dos would be taken to mean that it was
released as a Native DOS Beta copy on the 300th day of 1996.

     The reason for the change in the numbering system is a practical one.
With this method of numbering, there will be no question as to when a version
was released, and whether or not it is newer or older than another version.

  &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;
  Upgrading from 5-11 Exp
  &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

     One of the changes Patrick Spence made when he took over Renegade
production was to consolidate the updates into one archive. Previously,
upgrades were done by getting the upgrade package, copying over the
RENEGADE.EXE and RENEGADE.OVR files, and then making any changes outlined
in the WHATSNEW file.

However, now things have gotten extremely easy. :) Upgrading is as simple
as unzipping the distribution into a temporary directory and running
UPGRADE.EXE, this will extract and implement the necessary files for the
upgrade.

Going from 5-11 Exp to 98-xxx will involve some work. The Who's On List,
Last Callers list, User List, and BBS List are now configurable. The MCI
codes to use in these files are detailed in the WHATSNEW.XXX as well as in
Chapter 4. Also, the way Renegade pads MCI codes has changed, so you'll
want to recheck all your files to make sure everything looks the way you
want it to with the new padding scheme.

&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

        Unzip the distribution archive into a temporary directory, and

That's it. :)

     Renegade is started by changing to the main Renegade directory, and
typing 'RENEGADE'. If you do not have a fossil driver installed, you will
receive a message to that effect. If you wish to load Renegade without a
fossil driver, you must do so in Local mode, using the -L parameter,
detailed below.

     Renegade accepts the following Commandline Parameters:

        &#9472;Bnnnnn   This command tells the BBS that a user is already
                  connected at nnnnn baud. When loading Renegade
                  with this parameter, the WFC screen will be skipped
                  and the user will be dropped directly into the logon
                  sequence.

        &#9472;EEnnn    If a critical error occurs during the operation of the
                  BBS, it aborts to DOS with an ERRORLEVEL value of nnn.

        &#9472;ENnnn    Whenever a user logs off, and the -Q parameter is
                  specified on the commandline, Renegade returns an
                  errorlevel of 0 if no new echomail was entered, and
                  an errorlevel of 2 if new echomail was entered. This
                  commandline changes the errorlevel Renegade will
                  exit with to nnn.

                  NOTE: When pressing Q from the WFC screen, Renegade will
                        exit with an errorlevel of 255, regardless of whether
                        or not this parameter is used.

        &#9472;Ixxx     If you wish to pass Called ID information to Renegade,
                  use this parameter. This is most likely to be used in
                  conjunction with a Front-End Mailer that supports Caller
                  ID.

        &#9472;Kxx      This changes the screen display mode to 25, 43, and 50
                  lines respectively. ie, -K25 will change Renegade to
                  25 line mode (the default), -K43 will change Renegade to
                  43 line mode, and so on.

        &#9472;L        This tells Renegade to load itself in local mode. While
                  in local mode, Renegade will ignore the modem entirely (it
                  won't send anything out to the modem, and won't respond to
                  incoming calls)
                  
        &#9472;Mn       Will create a QWK mail packet for user n then return
                  to DOS.

        &#9472;Nn       Specifies which node to load (ie, -N1 loads Node 1, -N2
                  loads Node2, etc.). *Make Certain* that you've turned
                  multinode support on in the Main System Configuration before
                  you implement this parameter on your commandline.

        &#9472;P        Pack the message bases and return to DOS. 

        &#9472;S        Sort the File areas and return to DOS.

        &#9472;Q        Quit to DOS instead of the WFC screen upon logoff.

        &#9472;Un       Will upload a REP mail packet for user n then return to
                  DOS.

        &#9472;Xnnnn    External event start time in nnnn minutes.  Renegade will
                  treat this as a built in hard event and log the user off
                  in nnnn minutes.

  &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

          A         Sends the &quot;modem answer&quot; command to the modem.  It is
                    normally not used, but for testing the connections and
                    when you have an error, this is helpful. If everything is
                    configured correctly, the BBS should automatically answer
                    the phone.

          B         Enters the Message Base Editor (See Chapter 9)
                    
          C         Displays todays list of callers.

          D         Drops to the OS command shell, allowing you to
                    use some commands that aren't available through
                    Mini-DOS. Type EXIT to retrun to the WFC Screen.

          E         Enters the Event Editor (See Chapter 12)

          F         Enters the File Base Editor (See Chapter 8)

          H         Sends the Hangup string to the modem.

          I         Sends the Initialization string to the modem.

          L         Displays the Sysop Logs. You can display either todays
                    log, or the backlog for up to how ever many days you
                    define as the maximum in the System Configuration.

          M         Allows reading of All Email messages posted to the
                    system. It does not specify the viewing of a particular
                    users email.

          N         Displays the list of users currently online. (MultiNode
                    Only)

          O         Sends the Offhook string to the modem

          P         Allows the Sysop to pack the message bases.

          Q         Exits the BBS and returns to the OS with an ERRORLEVEL of
                    255.

          R         Prompts for a username, and then displays the contents
                    of that users mailbox.

          S         Enters the System Configuration. (See Chapter 6)
                    
          U         Enters the User Editor. (See Chapter 7)

          V         Enters the Voting Editor (See Chapter 13)

          W         Allows you to send Email messages to other users,
                    either individually or via various mass mail criteria.

          X         Enters the Protocol Editor (See Chapter 10)

          Z         Displays the usage log information contained in the
                    HISTORY.DAT file, which contains a record of all general
                    system activity.  Just to note, the percent activity is
                    roughly the number of minutes used that day divided by
                    1440 minutes (24 hours).

          #         Enters the Menu Editor (See Chapter 11)

          !         Validate Files - If you're not setup to autovalidate
                    uploads, this will allow you to validate them either
                    manually or automatically.

          [SPACE]   Brings up the WFC local logon prompt. Choosing Y
                    will proceed with a normal logon, pressing F will
                    do a fast logon (skips most of the welcome screens)
                    and pressing N returns you to the WFC. If Local Security
                    Protection is turned On, the Fast Logon option will
                    not be available.

          $         Loads the Conference Editor (See Chapter 14)                
    

          [TAB]     Switches you between modem and WFC mode.  In modem mode,
                    you can send commands to the modem, but if the phone
                    rings, Renegade will still answer the call.

          If Local Security Protection is turned On (See Chapter 6-E),
          then only two commands are available from the WFC Screen; [SPACE]
          and Q. Pressing Q will exit to DOS, just like the normal WFC
          command. [SPACE] will bring up a prompt for the sysop password.
          If the password is entered correctly, then the WFC can be used
          normally. If someone logs on, when they logoff the WFC screen
          will blank and then ask for the Password again. If the password
          is entered, and the WFC screen remains idle, after a time it'll
          prompt for the password again before functioning normally.

  Chapter 2 - Sysop Function Keys
&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

     The following function keys are available only when a user is online:
     (Alt-x, where x is the letter you're pressing; Alt key+x key together)
      
          Alt-B          Toggles &quot;beep&#9472;after&#9472;end&quot; on and off.  This feature
                         will take the phone offhook and sound an alarm when
                         the user logs off, letting you know that the system
                         is available for use.

          Alt-C          Toggles chat mode on and off.

          Alt-E          Allows modification of the user's security
                         information (SL, DSL, AR &amp; AC flags, file points).
                         Prints the &quot;SysOp working&quot; string to the user while
                         this window is displayed.

          Alt-F          Prints fake line noise to the user.

          Alt-G          Allows enabling and disabling of activity trapping
                         and chat capturing for a user.

          Alt-H          Hang up on a user and return to the WFC menu.

          Alt-I          Toggles the User's input On and Off. For the
                         obvious reasons, user input is toggled On. If
                         toggled Off, then the users keystrokes won't do
                         anything.

          Alt-K          Allows you to select a Hangup message to display
                         (HANGUPnn.*) before hanging up on the user and
                         returning to the WFC menu.

                         This option has caused an undue amount of confusion
                         in it's time. When you press Alt-K, the following
                         prompt appears in the Sysop Window.

                         Display what hangup file (HANGUPxx) :
                          &gt;

                         The prompt is misleading; it can be interpreted
                         as telling a sysop to input the entire filename
                         of the hangup file they want to display.

                         Uh uh. Let's say you've got hangup files HANGUP1.ASC
                         and HANGUP11.ANS. In order for the file to display,
                         you must type the number of the HANGUP file and
                         nothing more. Ie; When you want to display
                         HANGUP1.ASC, you would type 1 when prompted. If you
                         wanted to display HANGUP11.ANS, you'd type 11.

                         The prompt is also misleading in that it shows it'll
                         accept two characters. It is okay to use 1 character,
                         as in HANGUP1.ASC above. Renegade won't complain.
                         However, if you named the file HANGUP01.ASC and then
                         pressed 1 at the prompt, HANGUP01.ASC would not
                         display; Renegade would be looking for 01, not 1.
                         Basically, whatever you input is what Renegade is
                         going to be looking for after the HANGUP portion of
                         the filename.

                         
          Alt-L          Toggles the local screen on and off.

          Alt-M          Toggles temporary SysOp access for a user. If the
                         user still has Temp SysOp access when they logoff,
                         they will be returned to their original status
                         when next they call.

          Alt-N          Switches you to the next SysOp window in order.
                         Sysop Window must be turned on; see Alt-S

          Alt-O          Conference System toggle. If toggled to off, any
                         access levels requiring the user to be in a certain
                         conference are ignored. 

          Alt-P          Displays a file from the local harddisk to the
                         remote user.

          Alt-Q          Turns off the &quot;user attempted to chat&quot; alarm.
                         If a user pages the sysop when he's available and
                         the sysop doesn't answer, this annoying little
                         pager sound will continue. The only way to stop
                         it is to break into chat with the user, wait until
                         they logoff, or use Alt-Q. :)

          Alt-R          Displays the chat reason in the SysOp window.
                         Sysop Window must be turned on; see Alt-S

          Alt-S          Toggles the SysOp window on and off.

          Alt-T          Toggles the SysOp window display between the top
                         and bottom of the local screen.

          Alt-U          Toggles the user's input and output on and off.
                         Users input and output is toggled on at the
                         beginning of each call by default. If toggled
                         off, then the users keystrokes will not do anything.
                         In addition, the remote display will no longer
                         be updated; the remote user's screen is in essence
                         frozen until the sysop presses Alt-U again, or the
                         caller hangs up.

          Alt-V          Prompts the sysop for a validation level (as
                         defined in Subscription/Validation levels; See
                         Chapter 6-G) and then validates the online user
                         at the chosen level.

          Alt-W          Same as Alt-E except that the &quot;SysOp working&quot;
                         string is not displayed.

          Alt-Z          Sends a continuous stream of beeps until the user
                         presses a key or hangs up.

          Alt-+          Adds five minutes to a user's total time left.

          Alt--          Subtracts five minutes from a user's total time
                         left.

          Alt-(F1-F5)    Changes to SysOp Window 1&#9472;5 depending on which
                         Function key you hit (F1&#9472;F5). Sysop Window must
                         be turned on; see Alt-S

          F1&#9472;F10         Hitting one of these keys will activate the SysOp
                         Defined Macro that was defined in System Variables.
                         (See Chapter 6-D)

          Ctrl-Home      Shows a help screen with all of the SysOp function
                         keys and a brief description.

     The following function keys are available anywhere in the system,
     whether or not a user is online:

          Alt-n          Executes a batch file called &quot;GLOBATn.BAT&quot;, where
                         &quot;n&quot; is a number from 1 to 9. (ie, if you have a batch
                         file named GLOBAT1.BAT, and press Alt-1, Renegade
                         will immediately run that batch file, Alt-2 runs
                         GLOBAT2.BAT, and so on)

                         The GLOBATn.BAT files must be present in your main
                         BBS directory.                        

          Alt-D          Prompts for a filename and then captures the contents
                         of the screen to that filename. 

          Alt-J          Performs a local shell to DOS. Sends the &quot;SysOp
                         has shelled to DOS&quot; string before entering DOS,
                         and the &quot;thank you for waiting&quot; string after
                         returning.

          Scroll Lock    Toggles Sysop Availability for chat. If On, Sysop
                         is *not* available for chat at all. If Off, then
                         the regularly defined chat hours are used (if none
                         are defined, then the sysop pager will always be
                         active, unless Scroll Lock is turned On)
                         
          Ctrl-SysRq     Allows the SysOp to choose to generate a run
                         time error. (Cute, huh? :))

          &quot;N1ER&quot;   &#9472; Must be logged onto node 1 with RIP active.

     For added ACS control, there are five logical operators that can be
     used.

      For access to happen:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          &quot;&amp;&quot; &#9472; Logical AND   &#9472; both must be true
          &quot;|&quot; &#9472; Logical OR    &#9472; either can be true
          &quot;!&quot; &#9472; Logical NOT   &#9472; first is true second isn't

      These are the all on/off settings:
      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          &quot;^&quot; &#9472; Logical TRUE  &#9472; everything is true
          &quot;%&quot; &#9472; Logical FALSE &#9472; everything is false

     Examples:
     ~~~~~~~~
      AND &#9472; &quot;S20D50&quot; requires the user has an SL of 20 *AND* a DSL of 50.
      OR  &#9472; &quot;S20|FA&quot; requires that the user have either SL 20 *OR* AR flag &quot;A&quot;.
      NOT &#9472; &quot;!FA&quot; requires that the user *NOT* have AR flag &quot;A&quot;.

     The TRUE and FALSE operators are used to give everyone access, or to
     give nobody access.  &quot;^&quot; means ALL users have access, and &quot;%&quot;
     means NO users at all have access.

     For even more complex ACS's, parentheses are allowed to group ACS settings
     together to be compared to another set:
     &quot;S20FA|D255&quot; means that the user must have at least SL 20 *AND* AR flag
     &quot;A&quot; *OR* DSL 255.

     A few more examples:

          S50            User must have SL 50 or higher (50&#9472;255).
          !S50           User must *NOT* have SL 50 (0&#9472;49).
          VV|U1          User must be validated *OR* be user #1.
          A21FAS50       User must be 21 years old *AND* have AR flag &quot;A&quot;
                         *AND* have SL 50.
          !(A21FAS50)    User must *NOT* be 21 years old, have AR flag &quot;A&quot;,
                         or have SL 50.
          !N234          User must *NOT* be logged onto node 234.

  Unless otherwise noted, all files mentioned in this section must be present
  in your MISC directory off the Renegade main path.
 
  &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;
  Chapter 4&#9472;A: The BBS List
  &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

      Renegade's BBS List is now in binary format. It stores more information,
      and allows the person entering the BBS into the list to edit the
      information later. It displays in two formats, regular (the short,
      traditional format) and an extended version that includes much more
      thorough information. 

      The BBS List will now sort itself automatically, so no third party
      utils will be required. 

            Regular List:

              You can configure the format of the regular list with
              the following three files.

              BBSNH.xxx &lt;&#9472;&#9472; The Header 
              BBSNT.xxx &lt;&#9472;&#9472; The Trailer
              BBSMN.xxx &lt;&#9472;&#9472; The information displayed in between

            Extended Format:

              You can configure the format of the extended list with
              the following three files.

               BBSEH.xxx &lt;&#9472;&#9472; The Header
               BBSET.xxx &lt;&#9472;&#9472; The Trailer
               BBSME.xxx &lt;&#9472;&#9472; The information displayed in between

      In BBSMx.xxx, you can use the following local MCI codes:

    ~BN   BBS Name      ~DA   Date Added        ~DE   Date Edited
    ~DS   Description   ~PN   Phone Number      ~SN   SysOp Name
    ~SP   Speed         ~SW   Software          ~UN   User Added

      You are limited to 1024 bytes in BBSMx.xxx and all other configurable
      listings. Since this is for each entry, and *before* MCI interpretation,
      if you use that much, people are going to fall asleep waiting for the
      listing to end.

  &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

  Renegade's Last Callers List is now configurable: 

      Header: LASTH.xxx
      Middle: LASTM.xxx
      Trailer: LASTT.xxx

      You can customize LASTM.xxx with the following local MCI codes:

~CA   Caller number     ~DK   Download Kbytes       ~DL   Downloads
~ES   Email sent        ~FS   Feedback sent         ~LC   Location

  Renegade's Who's On Listing is now configurable:

      Header: NODELH.xxx
      Middle: NODELM.xxx
      Trailer: NODELT.xxx

     You can customize NODELM.xxx with the following local MCI codes:

    ~AC  Activity           ~AG  Age        ~AT  Node active (Y/N)
    ~AV  Available (Y/N)    ~LC  Location   ~TO  Time On
    ~NN  Node number        ~UN  Name       ~RM  Room number
    ~SX  Sex

 Renegade's User Listing is now configurable:

      Header: USERH.xxx
      Middle: USERM.xxx
      Trailer: USERT.xxx

     You can customize USERM.xxx with the following local MCI codes:

This file has gone undocumented for a very long time. :) What it is, simply,
is a plaintext file called TRASHCAN.TXT in your MISC directory containing the
names of people, or words, that you do not want to be able to apply to your
system. The format is one name per line, one after the other.

 Example:

    ---BEGIN FILE---
    Ken Reaverson
    Adrian Blood
    Pretty Hate Machine
    ---END FILE---

If I were to apply to your board, and this is what your TRASHCAN.TXT looked
like, I would receive the message 'Sorry, can't use that name' and prompted
to enter my name/handle again. It is not case sensitive, but it is spelling
sensitive. Also, there are no wildcards allowed (Adrian* will not prevent
Adrian Paul, Adrian Blood, or Adrian Blackburn from applying to your system
;))

        This file, if it exists, will be sent to a new user when his account
        is saved to the user record. The file should be left in the MISC
        directory. It has the following format:

        &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

        [FROM]
        [SUBJECT]
        { MESSAGE TEXT (FIRST LINE)
                .
                .
                .
          (LAST LINE) }


        &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

        Each is on a separate line, and FROM is on the first line.  Any
        replies to this message are sent to the same user number as the
        new user application.

  Chapter 4&#9472;G: The Global Menu
  &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

        The Global Menu is an optional menu that can do some pretty cool
        stuff. Any command inserted into the global menu can be run from
        anywhere on the BBS. All regular Menu CmdKeys will work, with one
        exception. The GOSUB (-/) command will not work from the Global Menu.

        If the Global Menu is not already present, you'll have to create
        it yourself. Be very careful how you assign commands on the Global
        Menu. Make sure that the letters you assign aren't used anywhere
        else on the BBS, or they'll be run in sequence, and the results
        will probably be something different than what you had hoped for.

        Example:

        Let's say I want to insert a command that will check and see
        what users are online. I create a menu named GLOBAL.MNU in my
        MENU directory. I load up the Menu Editor and insert a new command
        that looks something like this:

        Menu filename: GLOBAL
        Command #1 of 2

        1. Long descript :(/W)ho's Online
        2. Short descript:(/W)ho's Online
        3. Menu keys     :/W
        4. ACS required  :&quot;&quot;
        5. Cmdkeys       :NO
                         ;(This is the CmdKey for the Who's On List)
        6. Options       :
           Flags         :None
        Q. Quit

        From now on, no matter where I am, if I press /W, the Who's On List
        will display. Now, imagine if I had assigned the Menu Key as L
        instead of /W. If that had been the case, anywhere there was an L
        command already present, it would have run the present command first,
        and then the global one. So at the Main Menu, the Callers Today list
        would have displayed, followed immediately by the Whos On list.

        If you had to create the GLOBAL.MNU yourself, delete the Quit to
        Main Menu command already present in the menu; it's redundant.

        If there's a menu you *don't* want using the global commands, you can
        turn them off. Most of the default menus allow the use of the Global
        commands, and all new menus you create default to being able to use
        the menu commands. See Chapter 11-B for information on changing
        whether or not a menu uses the global commands.

  &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;
  Chapter 4&#9472;H: The READP, FILEP, and NEWINFO Menus
  &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

        All three of the menus in this section must exist in the MENU
        directory off the main Renegade Path.

        READP.MNU

        This is the menu that's used while reading any message on the BBS.
        Do *not* delete this file under any circumstance, and do not
        rename it. Renegade looks for the filename READP.MNU, bad things
        happen when it doesn't exist. ;)

        You can change the menu prompt, add in extra commands, and modify
        it just like any other menu, just be careful to keep the message
        reading and replying commands there. ;)

        FILEP.MNU

        The FILEP.MNU serves the same function as the READP.MNU, except
        it's used when listing files. The cautions with the READP.MNU
        apply here as well, do *not* delete or rename this file.

        NEWINFO.MNU

        As above, do not delete or rename this file, Renegade expects it,
        and new users won't be able to complete the application process if
        it doesn't exist.

        This is the final step before the user is actually saved to the
        user record. At this menu, they can change the information they've
        been asked during the application process. It is important to note;
        while at this menu, the user does not have a user number. Do not
        use any commands which will check for a user number, because it'll
        bomb out.

 Chapter 5 - Changing Colors
&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

     There are 2 easy ways of changing colors in Renegade.  The first
     method is usable almost everywhere in Renegade.  When you're where you
     want to change to another color, press [Ctrl&#9472;P] and then enter a number
     from 0&#9472;9.  Control&#9472;P is actually a macro type of key, because when you
     do hit Control P, a ^ appears.  The ^ is the actual, better way to change
     the colors.  From then on, the color will be the one you set with the last
     command.  It will stay the same color until the color is changed again by
     either the system or by another color code sequence.


            NOTE: Just because the [Ctrl&#9472;P] key sequence does not produce
            ~~~~  the &quot;^&quot;, doesn't mean you cannot change the color.  Simply
                  enter the &quot;^&quot; yourself.

            NOTE: As of 4&#9472;05 Exp, pressing Ctrl&#9472;P then the # will produce
                  the string. ie, [ctrl&#9472;p] 1 will produce &quot;^1&quot;. In
                  previous versions, the color change was instant and
                  the user never saw the ^# part of the string.


     Another way which can be used is called the Pipe System.  Where you
     want to change the color, enter a &quot;|nn&quot; (w/out quotes).  The nn is a
     number between 00 and 23. (2 digits MUST be used.).  The first 16 colors
     (00&#9472;15) affect the foreground color, and the last 8 (16&#9472;23) affect the
     background color.  The colors are as follows: (B. = Bright, D. = Dark)

        00: Black       08: D. Grey     16: Black
        01: Blue        09: B. Blue     17: Blue
        02: Green       10: B. Green    18: Green
        03: Cyan        11: B. Cyan     19: Cyan
        04: Red         12: B. Red      20: Red
        05: Purple      13: B. Purple   21: Purple
        06: Brown       14: Yellow      22: Brown
        07: Grey        15: B. White    23: White

      NOTE: On some cases, if you have used the ^# method of changing colors
      ~~~~  and the color you changed to with the ^ was flashing, you might
            have to enter another NON&#9472;FLASHING ^ code before you enter
            a pipe code.

   The main part of keeping Renegade set and going is the way you set up the
   system configuration.  This section is normally selected by the &quot;S&quot; command
   at the WFC screen.

     Once there, the following menu is displayed:
     &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

          A    This option allows you to enter the name and the phone
               number of your BBS. The Name defined here is what will be
               displayed by the %BN MCI Code, and the Phone number is what
               will be displayed by the %BP MCI Code.

          B    This option allows you to enter the username of the SysOp.
               This is mostly cosmetic; the only thing this option determines
               is what the %SN MCI Code will display.

          D    This option allows you to declare your chat hours.  When
               someone pages you during these hours, a bell will sound to
               inform you that a user wishes to chat.

               NOTE: If you do not declare chat hours, your users will
                     be able to page you at all hours.

          E    This option defines the hours that the minimum baud rate
               callers may log on.  Some SysOps prefer to restrict the hours
               available to users of lower baud modems for various reasons.

          F    This option defines the hours that file downloading is
               allowed.

          G    This option defines the hours that low baud callers may
               download files.

          H    This option brings up something like the following display:

                        System Passwords:
                          A. SysOp password        :DOWN
                          B. New user password     :FOR
                          C. Baud override password:LIFE

                             A. Defines the SysOp Password. This is the only
                                one of the three passwords that must be
                                defined. In general, this is the password
                                that will be prompted for when using all
                                Sysop specific commands.

                             B. If this is defined, then any newuser applying
                                to the system will need to input this password
                                when prompted before continuing with the
                                application process. If this password is
                                not defined, then nothing will be asked for,
                                and a user may apply to the system unhindered.

                             C. If this password is defined and a user
                                connects at a baud rate lower than the
                                minimum logon baud rate defined in the
                                System Variables (See Chapter 6-D), then
                                the user will be prompted for this password.
                                If they get it right, they'll be allowed
                                to logon. If they get it wrong, Renegade
                                will hang up on them. If the password
                                is not defined and a user connects at a
                                lower baud rate than allowed, they'll simply
                                be hung up on.

          I    This options sets the number of seconds before a scheduled
               event is run in which the user is warned. In other words,
               if you've got an event running in two minutes, and this option
               is set to 60 seconds, Renegade would warn the user one minute
               before the event logged them off. If you an event was about
               to run in 5 minutes, and this option was set to 300 seconds,
               then the user would be warned five minutes in advance.
              

          J    Menu where users with an undefined Startout menu will start
               from.  (Normally set to MAIN)  The Startout menu is the menu
               which the user is first in contact with.  Some SysOps prefer
               to have the menu set to something else to perform some type
               of maintenance before the user gets to the main menu.

          K    Prefix of the Bulletin Files. (Normally left Blank or set to
               BULLET)  Refer to Chapter 11&#9472;D&#9472;12, Sub&#9472;Bulletins under the
               OS CmdKey for an explanation.

          L    This option allows you to tell Renegade if it has 1 or more
               nodes.  (If multi&#9472;node, you must use the &#9472;Nx command to load
               node x.)

          M    This option will allow you to turn the Network mode on.  It
               activates the following:

                a) Forces local security on.
                b) Disables all function keys unless a SysOp is logged on.
                c) Disables the SysOp window system.
                d) All WFC commands are disabled except [SPACE] and Q.
                e) If no node is specified on the command line, the node
                   will assume it is a local node, and automatically
                   configure itself as the next available node number.

                   NOTE: As of this writing, e is broken; Renegade will
                   load in local mode, but it'll load as node 1, even if
                   there is a node one already loaded. The authors have been
                   informed of the problem; the moral of the story is to
                   make damned sure you load a node number on the commandline.

          R    This option defines the drive where multinode and such
               information is stored.  This can be a RAM drive to increase
               performance. The MultiNode Data &lt;MULTNODE.DAT&gt; file (which
               stores who is on what node, their location, activity, sex,
               time online) and any messages sent from one node to another
               are stored in this directory.

          0    This option defines the directory in which your main data
               files are stored. (.DAT, .DIR, etc.)

          1    This option defines the directory in which your text files
               are stored.  (.ANS, .ASC, .INF, .ASW, etc.)

          2    This option defines the directory in which your messages
               are stored. (.BRD, .MIX, etc.)

          3    This option defines the directory in which the menu files
               are stored. (.MNU)

          4    This option defines the directory in which the Version 7
               Nodelist files will be stored. A Version 7 Nodelist is
               something compiled by a third party program. It is *not*
               the text file containing names, locations and phone numbers,
               and so on; that's the raw nodelist. The author of this
               documentation recommends QNode, written by James West, which
               should be available on any decent support BBS.

               What a Version 7 Nodelist does is aid in sending Netmail.
               If a Version 7 Nodelist exists, Renegade is able to fill
               in most of the blanks for you. When sending netmail without
               a Version 7 Nodelist defined, Renegade will ask for the
               following: Name of recipient, their address, and then the
               subject. It is quite possible for a message to be addressed
               incorrectly in this manner. If a Version 7 nodelist is
               defined, Renegade is a little more helpful; When sending
               Netmail, Renegade will ask for either a name or address:

               Enter a name, a Fidonet address, or an Internet address.
               :

               The Name it's looking for in this case is the name of the
               sysop, which is not necessarily the person you want to
               address the netmail to. If you don't know the name of the
               sysop, but you do know the address, use it. If you enter
               an invalid address, Renegade will form you of as much and
               ask you to try again. If you enter a valid address, a screen
               something like the following pops up:

               Enter a name, a Fidonet address, or an Internet address.
               :1:114/252

               System: The Courts of Chaos (1:114/252)
               SysOp : Patrick Spence
               Phone : 1-602-241-1039
               Where : Mesa Az
               Cost  : 0 credits

               Is this correct? No

               If you confirm this is the correct information, Renegade will
               next ask who you want this addressed this netmail (it'll fill
               in the sysops name by default).

               By using a Version 7 nodelist, the mail isn't going to be
               addressed to a non-existent node. It also makes a user confirm
               their choice, thereby lessening the chances of accidentally
               addressing the netmail somewhere else.
             
          5    This option defines the directory in which the trap files,
               system log files and capture chat files are stored. (.LOG)

          6    This option defines the directory in which temporary files
               are stored.  This directory is used for various things to
               hold files while using them, but when they aren't permanent.

          7    This option defines the directory in which the protocol drivers
               will be held.  These include DSZ.EXE, HSLINK.EXE, etc. These
               files are used in the Protocol Editor as your file transfer
               programs.

          8    This option defines the directory in which the archive drivers
               will be held.  These include PKUNZIP.EXE, ARJ.EXE, PKZIP.EXE,
               RAR.EXE, etc.

          9    This option defines the directory in which the files which are
               attached to Email and Netmail are to be sent to.

     Note that the command strings can contain the following special
     characters:

          &quot;|&quot;       Sends a carriage return (^M) to the modem.

          &quot;^x&quot;      Sends a control character to the modem. (^M can be typed
                    as a | here.)

          &quot;~&quot;       Performs a half&#9472;second delay before sending the next
                    character to the modem.

          &quot;^&quot;       Toggles DTR for .25 seconds.

     Each menu option is described in detail below.

          1    This is where you can set the maximum baud rate of your
               modem. If you're locking the COM port, this is the speed
               at which the port will be locked.

          2    This is the COM port that this nodes modem is connected to,
               which can be COM1 through COM64.

          3    This is the command that initializes the modem.  This is
               VERY important, as it tells the modem how to operate under
               the BBS environment.

               Words of Advice: If your modem has the ability to store user
                                profiles in its volatile memory, use it.
                                Renegade likes a short init string.

          4    This is the command that Renegade sends to the modem in order
               to answer an incoming call.

          5    This is the command that hangs up the modem.

               NOTE: As of 4&#9472;05 Exp, if the hangup string is not defined,
                     or does not contain a DTR toggle, the modem will not
                     hangup. In this way, Renegade may be used as a Door. Make
                     damned sure there's a ^ somewhere in that string. I
                     personally use only ^. It's quite effective at dropping
                     carrier. :)

          6    This is the command that places the modem (and, consequently,
               the phone line) offhook.

          7    This option toggles whether or not the COM port is locked. If
               your modem supports rates above 2400 baud, make sure this
               is set to On.

          8    This option should be set if you are using a DigiBoard.
               What a Digiboard is, and what it does, is beyond the scope
               of this document. 

          9    This option toggles CTS/RTS flow control on or off.  Flow
               control tells the computer or modem when to start and stop
               sending or receiving information to/from the other device.
               (CTS/RTS is also known as Hardware Flow Control.)

          A    This option toggles XON/XOFF flow control on and off. (See
               information above about CTS/RTS flow control.  XON/XOFF is
               also known as Software Flow Control.) Pick one or the other,
               but don't use both. The CTS/RTS is the preferable Flow Control.

          B    The complete path to where the door files (CALLINFO.BBS,
               DORINFOx.DEF, DOOR.SYS, etc.) will be written for this node.
               (If blank, files are written to main BBS directory)

               If you define this directory, you must create it. Renegade will
               not do it for you.

          C    A User must meet the ACS that is set here in order to login
               to this node. If they do not, when they login, the BBS will
               hang up on them.

          D    The string defined here is what will be displayed in front
               of normal text sent from this node while in Teleconference.
            
          E    The string defined here is what will be displayed in front
               of an anonymous message sent from this node while in
               Teleconference.

          F    The string defined here is what will be displayed in front
               of a message sent from this node to the users current
               Global Channel while in Teleconference. (see Chapter 20
               for more information on Teleconference and Global Channels)

          G    The string defined here is what will be displayed in front
               of a Private message sent from this node while in
               Teleconference.

          H    Important Note: This option does *not* tell Renegade which
               IRQ to use for this node. This option is cosmetic only; the
               value here is what will be shown by the %E MCI Code.

          I    Important Note: This option does *not* tell Renegade what
               port address to use for this node. This option is cosmetic
               only; the value defined here is what will be shown by the %C
               MCI Code.

               If you need to set the comport to use a different IRQ and
               port address, you must do this through your fossil driver,
               not Renegade.

          J    If you want the BBS to answer on a ring other then the first
               ring, enter the number here.

          K    This will toggle the option to use the MultiRing (also called
               RingMate, and Distinctive Ringing) option.  (Pick up after the
               set number of secondary rings.)

          R    These are the result codes returned by the modem when the NO
               CARRIER and other various baud rate conditions are encountered.
               The menu that appears looks like this:

      A&#9472;D, and G through X are default result codes, and for all Hayes
      Compatible modems, these shouldn't be changed.

      E is the string that is received when you get CID information. Different
      modems use different strings; some use NMBR =, some use CALR =. Check
      your modems manual to find out which one you support.
      
      F is a toggle for CID.  If you want the information (Phone Number,
      Name, etc.) to be inserted in the User's User Note, toggle this on.
      If you don't have CID, or don't want it inserted in the Note, leave
      this off.

          A    This setting defines the security level for a full SysOp.

               NOTE: This also defines the level for which the //\\XX global
                     command keys can be set. I highly recommend this be
                     set to u1 instead of s255.

          B    This is the ACS Level that a user must have in order to
               be qualified as a Full Co-Sysop.

          C    This setting defines the security level for a message base
               SysOp.

          D    This setting defines the security level for a file base
               SysOp.

               NOTE: C and D are more or less obsolete these days. With
               the addition of the FILEP and READP menus, a sysop can
               change who has access to what commands. In addition, each
               message base has it's own setting for Sysop ACS. You can
               change the strings as they're defined here, but they don't
               really do anything. :)
               
          E    This setting defines the security level in which the SysOp
               password must be specified during the logon process.

          F    This is the access needed to add a voting choice when the
               topic is added with &quot;add choices off&quot;.

          G    This setting defines the security level required to post
               normal public mail.

          H    This setting is similar to option G, except that it pertains
               to normal Email.

               NOTE: If you set this to a higher ACS than a New User who
               has just applied to the system has, they *will not* be able
               to send a newuser letter to the sysop. 

          I    If a user qualifies for this ACS level, they will be able to
               see the real name or handle on any anonymous public messages.

               The message header would look something like this:

               Date: 8:49 pm  Fri Apr 10, 1998        Number : 1 of 1

               Only those meeting this ACS see the Real: portion of the

          J    This setting is similar to option I above, except that it
               pertains to normal Email instead of public messages.
               
          K    This setting defines the security level that allows a user
               to post anonymously on ANY message base. If a user meets this
               ACS, it will override the individual anonymous settings for
               each individual message base (the one exception to this is if
               it's set to %; if % is used, then the individual base settings
               will still be honored.) If you use ^ here, then users will be
               able to post anonymously on any public message base, regardless
               of the individual settins.

          L    This setting is similar to option K, except that it deals with
               Email.

          M    This setting defines the security level that allows a user
               to see unvalidated files when looking through the file lists.

          N    This setting defines the security level that allows a user
               to download unvalidated files.

          O    This setting defines the security level at which upload/
               download ratio checking is turned off.

          P    This setting defines the security level at which the post/
               call ratio check is turned off.

          R    This setting defines the security level at which file point
               checking is turned off.

          S    This setting defines the security level at which uploaded
               files are automatically credited to the uploader.  (This is
               useful to prevent uploading of &quot;garbage&quot; files to balance an
               UL/DL ratio for further downloading.)

          T    This setting defines the ACS needed to use MCI codes in the
               teleconference area.

          U    This setting defines the security level at which a user can
               force a chat page with the SysOp when he is not available.

          V    This setting defines the security level at which a user can
               send Netmail to another BBS on a network.

          W    This setting defines the security level at which a user can
               logon to the BBS (in multi&#9472;node mode only) and be &quot;Invisible&quot;
               to the other nodes when they log on, and in the node listing

          X    This setting defines the security level at which a user can
               &quot;attach&quot; a file to mail that they send on the board.

          Y    This setting defines the security level at which a user can
               change his vote in the voting section.

          A    This option sets the limit for the amount of Email that
               any single caller can leave during a call.

          B    This option sets the limit for the number of feedback
               messages that any single caller can send during a call.

          C    This option sets the limit for the number of public messages
               that any single caller can send during a call.

          D    This option sets the limit for the number of chat attempts
               that any single caller can make during a call.

          E    This option sets the limit for the amount of Email that can
               be kept waiting for a certain user.

          F    This option sets the limit for the amount of Email that can
               be kept waiting for a Co&#9472;SysOp.

          G    This option sets the number of logons a user can have before
               the BBS checks to see (as a security feature) if the user
               knows what the birthdate they entered into the BBS at the first
               logon.

          H    This option tells the BBS where to swap memory to when the
               BBS &quot;swaps&quot; out of Renegade. The locations are either (D)isk,
               (E)MS Memory, (X)MS Memory, (N)on XMS Extended Memory or
               (A)nywhere.

          I    This option sets the number of attempts a user can make to
               log on to the BBS, before the BBS hangs up on them.

          J    This option sets the amount of days before a user has to
               change their password as a security precaution.

          K    This option sets the SysOp chat color.  This only matters
               to the users that can view ANSI colors, as this color is the
               one that is used while the SysOp is typing.

          L    This goes along with option K, except that it's the user chat
               color.  (In case you're wondering.. the reason there are 2
               different colors for chat is basically so that the SysOp and
               user knows who said what.)

          M    This option sets the minimum amount of hard drive space (in K)
               that must be available on the hard drive in order to post a
               message.

          N    Pretty much the same as option M, except that it deals with the
               minimum amount of free space in order to upload. If less than
               this space is available, uploads will not be permitted.

          O    This option sets the number of days that the SysOp back logs
               are kept.  (Maximum is 15 days.)

          P    This option sets the time of inactivity before the WFC screen
               is blanked.  (Screen Saver)

          R    When a user pages the Sysop, and he doesn't answer, the PC
               speaker on his end will continue to emit a very irritating
               sound to let him know someone tried to page him. This option
               defines the number of seconds between the irritating noises.
            
          S    This option defines the number of calls the BBS has received.
               This number is automatically incremented each time a user
               remotely logs into the BBS.

          T    This option defines the minimum baud rate that can call into
               the BBS. (This is normally used to &quot;lock&#9472;out&quot; 300 baud users
               who are too slow to do much.)

          U    This option defines the minimum baud rate that can download
               files from the BBS. (See note on option T)

          0&#9472;9  These are the F1&#9472;F10 SysOp Definable Macros that only the SysOp
               can use on the BBS. If the sysop presses F1 on the local
               keyboard, then what is defined as the F1 macro is what will
               be displayed.

          A    This option specifies whether or not handles are allowed on
               the system.  (A handle is an alias.  Like CB Radio.) Some
               users like the anonymous aspect of BBSing, but it IS your
               choice.

          B    This option specifies whether or not the user's phone number
               is asked for during the logon process.

          C    This option controls local security protection. When Local
               Security Protection is turned on, the sysop password must be
               entered from the WFC screen in order to do anything (though
               the Q command still works from the WFC screen, regardless
               of whether or not Local Security Protection is on). Also,
               all passwords will be masked on the local display, as if it
               were remote. This is useful if the local computer is located in
               a place where many people might be passing near it. This not
               only protects your user data, but prevents others from possibly
               causing harm to your BBS. All told, if you're the only one
               that ever sits down in front of your computer, it's safe to
               leave this Off.

          D    This option specifies whether or not the RENEGADE.OVR file
               is to be accessed from EMS (expanded) memory.  If the overlay
               can't be stored in EMS, Renegade will access the overlay from
               disk as usual. (Accessing the overlay via EMS is *much* faster
               than accessing it from disk.)

               NOTE: As of Renegade vXX&#9472;XXX, the overlay will load into
                     XMS if it is available. This can speed things up
                     and free up RAM if you unload your EMS driver.

          E    This option controls global activity trapping.  If set to
               On, it will log everything every user does to disk. 
               (Trust me, turn this off. The trap file will eat your hard
               drive space very quickly.)

          F    This option specifies whether or not to automatically open
               the chat buffer during a chat session. If On, the entire
               conversation will be recorded in the CHAT.LOG in your
               LOGS directory. 

          G    This option specifies whether or not the auto&#9472;message is
               displayed during the logon process.

          H    If this is On, and any Bulletins have been updated since
               the users last call, this will tell them which bulletins
               have been updated and ask if they'd like to see them. If
               it is turned off, nothing about bulletins will be said
               during login.
            
          I    This option specifies whether or not the last few callers list
               is displayed during the logon process.

          J    This option specifies whether or not the user's status is
               shown during the logon process. If so, then it will read
               the YOURINFO.ASC present in your MISC directory. If the file
               does not exist, nothing will be displayed. 

          K    This option specifies whether or not Renegade's color
               codes will be stripped from the SysOp log.

          L    This option specifies whether or not the phone should be
               taken off&#9472;hook during local logons.

          M    This option will toggle whether or not the messages going
               through teleconferencing should be logged or not.

          N    This option controls the &quot;compression&quot; of file and message
               base numbers.  This option takes a little explaining...

               Say you have ten message bases (1&#9472;10), and bases 2, 6 and 9
               are restricted from certain users.  Normally when the list of
               message areas is displayed, those areas are not shown, leaving
               a gap in the listings (1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10).  If this option
               is set to on, all the message base numbers are made contiguous
               (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) to the user. They user won't realize that
               they're restricted from seeing something.

               The tradeoff is that system performance might suffer a little
               bit, and that the number of areas you're allowed to have with
               compression On (2,048) is significantly smaller than the number
               you can have with it turned off (65,535).

          O    This option controls the search for duplicate files during
               the uploading procedure. If this is turned on, and Renegade
               detects a duplicate filename, the file just uploaded will be
               deleted.             

          P    This option controls the output of the SysOp log.  You have
               three choices.

               File only &#9472;&#9472; Puts the log in the SYSOPxx.LOG file.

               Printer &amp; file &#9472;&#9472; Same as File except it outputs the log to
                                 the printer also.

               Printer only &#9472;&#9472; Sends the log to the printer only.

               To date, the printer options are not working.

          R    This option specifies whether or not ROM BIOS routines are
               to be used for all local screen output.

          S    This option specifies whether or not IEMSI handshaking
               will take place or not.  IEMSI is simply when the user
               defines certain pieces of information in his terminal
               program such as Real Name, Address and such... it
               basically speeds up the logon.

          T    If this is on, then the BBS will not accept any new users.
               If it is off, they will be able to apply as normal.
               
          U    This option defines if Renegade will Swap memory if it shells
               out of the BBS. Renegade tends to default this to Off when
               installed. Trust me, turn it on. :)

          V    This option defines if the BBS will use the Shuttle Logon.

          W    This option toggles Chat call paging. (After a user pages you,
               the board buzzes you to remind you that the user wants to chat.)

          X    This option defines if the time limits are per call or per
               day.

          Y    This option defines if most options (some are logon, most
               functions in SysOp menu, etc.) ask for the SysOp password
               before letting you execute the command.

          1    This option defines the number of the user that will receive
               &quot;new user&quot; messages.

               NOTE: If you do not wish to have a new user message sent to
                     anyone, select [D]isable.

          2    This option specifies the number of minutes before the bell
               is sounded to alert the user that the system is about to
               &quot;time out&quot;.

                NOTE: If you do not wish this to go into effect, select
                      [D]isable

          3    This option specifies the number of minutes that are allowed
               to pass with no activity before the system &quot;times out&quot;.

                NOTE: If you do not wish this to go into effect, select
                      [D]isable

               converted to the current file base's archive setting.

          E    This command works with option H. If this is turned on, the user
               will receive the percentage defined in H of the files file point
               worth everytime the file is downloaded.
               
          F    This option will toggle whether or not Renegade will search an
               uploaded file for FILE&#9472;ID.DIZ.  (It is a file that describes
               what the file is, no matter what the user enters for
               information.  It is a standard also used by PC Board.)

          G    This option will toggle whether or not Renegade will

          I    This option defines how many points the user gets per file
               credits they've earned. ie, with the setting above, if a user
               uploaded a file worth 1 file point, they would receive 4.

          J    This option defines what 1 file point is equal to in K.
               (ie: if set to 10k, every 10k of a file will charge the user
               1 file point.)

          K    This option defines the percentage of time that a user is
               refunded after uploading a file.

          L    This option defines the file base that is set to &quot;SysOp only&quot;.
               This is for SysOp&#9472;only uploads which are sent by putting a &quot;\&quot;
               as the first character in the file description.

          M    This option specifies whether or not all uploaded files are
               to be auto&#9472;validated.

          N    This option defines the maximum number of kilobytes allowed
               in the temporary archive working directory.

          O    This option defines the minimum number of kilobytes that

     Offline Mail is a system where one computer takes messages, compresses
     it to a file, then you transfer it to the other computer, and it is
     processed.  This saves time online for other people to call, and to
     cut down on any phone charges.

                 utility)

                the BBS's messages offline with the other mail packets.
                If the file *.QWK already exists, the new packet will be
                renamed to *.QWA, then *.QWB, then *.QWC up to *.QWZ.

        F       This option can be set if you want people to have unlimited

                have left, let them d/l their mail packet).

          H    This string is the first line that is displayed when the user
               quotes a message.  There are four MCI codes in this string
               that will only work here.

                @D will display the date the reply was sent.

                @S will display the subject of the message.

        which will be your background. You are then asked if you want the
        foreground to be blinking. After you have entered your answers, you
        are displayed with what your selection looks like, and you're asked if
        it is what you wanted.

     The &quot;[&quot;  and &quot;]&quot; keys will allow you to move back and forth between
     each entry in the list.

          1    This option specifies whether or not the archive format is
               active.

          2    This option specifies the extension used for files saved in
               the particular archive format.

          3    This option defines the way the board is to view the contents
               of archive files in the current format.

                    /1 &#9472; Uses the internal ZIP file viewer
                    /2 &#9472; Uses the internal ARC file viewer
                    /3 &#9472; Uses the internal ZOO file viewer
                    /4 &#9472; Uses the internal LZH file viewer
                    /5 &#9472; Uses the internal ARJ file viewer

               If you have defined an archive format that is not supported
               internally, use this option to define the Commandline required
               to view the archive's contents.

          4    This option defines the command line used to create or
               update an archive file using this format.

               If this line is blank, Renegade assumes the file is compressed.

               This is for people who want to test things such as GIF files,
               while leaving the Recompress Archive flag on.  Before, files
               would be deleted because they could not be compressed.

          5    This option is similar to option 4, except that it defines
               the Commandline used to extract files from an archive file.
               All rules and restrictions mentioned above also apply.

          6    This option is similar to option 4, except that it defines the
               Commandline needed to check the integrity of an archive file.

          7    This option is similar to option 4, except that it defines the
               Commandline used to add a comment to an archive file.

          8    This option defines the ERRORLEVEL value that the archiving
               program returns when an operation has been successfully
               completed.  Most programs return a level of 0.

     This section works like the Time Limitations section except this section
     sets the number of posts per call ratio that must be kept in order to have
     a correct PCR. (Helpful if you want to keep people out of the File transfer
     section until they get productive in posting, etc..)

  Some people have gotten confused about this section.  You want to enter the
  number of posts that a user of that Security Level (SL) would need for the ACS
  &quot;ZZ&quot;, per 100 calls.  (ie: if this was set to 25, the user would have to post
  25 messages for every 100 calls they make.  if they don't, they won't have ACS
  &quot;ZZ&quot;, and therefore can't do anything that you have &quot;ZZ&quot; in.)

          A    Alters the user's name.  If the BBS allows handles, this
               name can be set differently from the user's real name.

          B    Alters the user's real name.

          C    Alters the user's address.

          D    Alters the user's city and state/province.

          E    Alters the user's postal zip code.

          F    Alters the comment field if you want to be reminded of something
               about the user.

          G    Alters the user's answer to the 1st SysOp Definable Question.

          H    Alters the user's answer to the 2nd SysOp Definable Question.

          I    Alters the user's answer to the 3rd SysOp Definable Question.

          J    This command toggles the Status of the user:
                1) This command can be set to record every action of a
                   user from logon to logoff.
                2) This command is used to turn auto&#9472;chat buffering on.
                3) This command will output the users actions to a separate
                   SysOp log specific to the user.
                4) This command will alert the SysOp when the user logs on
                   the next time.

               The Display next to Status doesn't display the status of
               Chat buffer or SysOp Log, but notifies you if the user is
               Deleted or if they are locked out.

          K    Alters the configuration of the user's QWK packets.

          L    Alters the user's security level (SL).

          M    Alters the user's download security level (DSL).

          N    Allows toggling of the user's AR flags.

               NOTE: AR Flags can get complicated. Unlike AC Flags,
                     AR Flags are *not* predefined, you as the sysop
                     can use them for whatever you please. This is
                     done by ACS checking (see the Fx ACS level in
                     Chapter 3). For example, if I want to set access
                     to my file menu to users only with AR Flag F, I
                     change the access on the file menu via the menu
                     editor to read &quot;FF&quot; (without the quotation marks).
                     After doing this, if a user tries access the file
                     menu, and they do not have AR flag F toggled on, then
                     they will be denied access to the menu. If they do
                     have AR Flag F toggled on, they'll be allowed to access
                     the menu. In this manner, a sysop could pick and choose
                     who has access to the file menu simply by toggling that
                     users flags. 

          O    Allows toggling of the user's AC flags.

            AC Flag Definitions:

               U    Can't list users

               A    Can't write a AutoMessage.  This command will not allow

          5    This command sets the ACS settings that the user must have
               in order to download and upload to the file base.

          6    This is the maximum number of files allowed in a file base.
               If a user tries to upload a file when the maximum number of
               files is reached, the BBS will not allow the transfer.

          7    This options sets a password that a user must enter correctly
               password to enter the base.

          8    This enables file bases to be set up with different

               is kept on a CD&#9472;ROM or not.  If toggled on, it will disallow
               the file base to be newscanned.  Files on the CD&#9472;ROM (either
               Batch or Single Download) will be copied to the BBS Temporary
               Directory under the CD directory.  They are automatically
               purged as they are downloaded, or when the next user logs in.

          D    Date Uploaded Flag: This flag will show the date that the file
               was uploaded.

          F    Displays the first file base.

          G    GIFSpecs Flag: This flag is used for directories containing GIF
               pictures. If active, the BBS will insert in the description the
               size and color information about the files in the current base
               when the *8 CmdKey is used.

               area listing regardless of whether or not the user has access
               to that base. If the user lacks access, it will show in the
               directory list, but no base number will be shown.

  Chapter 8&#9472;A: Configuring CD-ROM File Areas
  &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

   CD-ROM areas are pretty easy to configure under RG. CD's are a
   nice addition to any BBS. They hold over half a gig of files, and
   unless you play frisbee with them, leave them under heat lamps, or
   practice other destructive little habits, the media will probably
   outlive you. :)

   NOTE: This section will assume that any CD you're adding will have
   all the files in one directory. If the CD you wish to add has more
   than one directory of files on it, repeat these steps for each directory
   on on the CD.

   Adding a CD to your BBS begins by creating a filebase for it. Make sure
   the Download Path is pointing to the CD drive and the directory the
   files are in (ie, if your CD-ROM is drive F: and the files are in BURN,
   set the path to F:\BURN)

   As for the upload path, you have a choice to make. Obviously, you can't
   upload files to the CD. You can still upload files to that filebase,
   they'll be stored in the UL path that you define. If you don't intend
   on storing any files beyond what's already on the CD, then set the UL
   path to the same as the DL path. 

   Press C to turn the CD-ROM flag on for the area. This is important;
   by turning the C flag on you're telling Renegade to copy the files off
   the CD and onto the local harddisk before transferring them to a
   remote system. I recommend this; downloading from a CD is *slow*, and
   if you're using a disc changer, you really do not want to the discs
   to change in the middle of someones download. :)

   It should look something like this:

         &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

   Next, put the CD into the drive, login, head to your file menu, change
   to the new filebase, and locally upload the files.

   Yes, this is slow. Yes, this is a pain in the ass. Yes, this can consume
   most of your afternoon before you realize it. Pray and hope that the files
   on the CD have FILE_ID.DIZ's or DESC.SDI's, otherwise you have to enter
   the descriptions by hand.

   There is an alternative. If there is a file named FILES.BBS anywhere on
   the CD, you can save yourself alot of pain and trouble. The FILES.BBS
   *should* contain the file descriptions for the files on the CD. There
   are several third party utilities available that can import the files
   and their descriptions listed in a FILES.BBS into your Renegade filebase.

   These individual programs will have their own documentation on how to
   import a FILES.BBS into your setup. You may have to do some searching
   to find one that works for you, however. I recommend RGMaint by Gary
   Hall.

          1    The name of the message base.

          2    The name of the message files.

          3    Designates the message base type.  Three types are currently
               available:

                    Local &#9472;&#9472; Allows the exchange of messages only between
                         the users of the BBS.

                    Echomail &#9472;&#9472; Allows the exchange of messages, via a FidoNet
                         type message network system.

                    QWKMail &#9472;&#9472; Adds origin lines and tear lines to messages,
                         but does not export or add addresses.  This is for
                         use with the QWK Networking feature.

               When a base is defined as Echomail, you will be prompted for a
               disk drive message path.

          4    The ACS requirements that the user must meet in order to
               access the message base.

          5    The user must have this ACS setting in order to post messages on
               this base.

          6    This is the ACS setting for users to have &quot;SysOp Commands&quot;
               available to them.  This is helpful for BBS moderators.

          7    This is the maximum number of messages that can be posted on
               the base. (Default is 100.) When the number of messages exceeds
               this limit old posts start getting removed when the base gets
               packed.

          8    This determines the anonymity level of the message base.
               Available anonymity levels are:

                    (Y)es, anonymous allowed.

                    (N)o, anonymous not allowed.

                    (F)orced Anonymous &#9472;&#9472; This automatically makes every
                         post on the base anonymous.

                    (D)ear Abby &#9472;&#9472; This is for a &quot;Dear Abby&quot; problem
                         solving message base.  A user may post a message
                         under ANY one of these three possibilities:

                              &quot;Problemed User&quot; &#9472;&#9472; Posted by a user who
                                   wants help, but wishes to remain anonymous.

                              &quot;Abby&quot; &#9472;&#9472; Allows another user to respond to a
                                   problem post, with anonymity.

                              User name and number &#9472;&#9472; Allows a caller to
                                   post a problem/suggestion under their
                                   handle and user number.

                    (A)ny Name &#9472;&#9472; Allows users to post messages using any name
                                   they like.

          9    When active, this will prompt a user for the password which
               must be entered correctly in order to access that message base.

          N    Let's you select another node number to use if you are involved
               with 2 of more mail networks. 

          C    Defines the colors used for standard text, quoted text,
               tear, and origin lines for Echomail and Groupmail messages.

          M    Defines the various flag settings used when tossing,
               scanning, and posting Echomail and Groupmail messages.  The
               currently available flags are:

                    K &#9472; Strip IFNA kludge lines.
                    S &#9472; Strip SEEN&#9472;BY lines (Echomail only).
                    O &#9472; Strip origin lines.
                    T &#9472; Add tear and origin lines to posted messages.
                    I &#9472; Sets the message base to Internet Status

          O    Defines the origin line placed at the bottom of Echomail and
               Groupmail messages.

          Q    Exits the message base editor.

          T    Allows you to edit the base's flag set.  

               Flag Definitions:

                R   Real Names Flag: If active, real names are stored in the
                    &quot;From:&quot; and &quot;To:&quot; fields of each message.

                U   Unhidden Flag: If active, it will display a message base
                    in an area listing regardless if the user has access to
                    that base. If the user does not have access to the base,
                    the name of the base will be shown without a base number.

                A   Strip 8-bit ASCII/ANSI Flag: If active, ANSI codes and
                    8&#9472;bit ASCII characters (127&#9472;255) are removed from messages
                    before they are posted.

                P   Private Messages Flag: If active, this allows private
                    posts to be allowed in the message base.

                     NOTE: If a Private message is posted within an echomail
                           base, it will still be sent out with the rest of
                           the mail. The Private flag affects local status
                           only.

                F   Forced Flag: If active, this will disable the Q command,
                    making the base a &quot;Mandatory Reading&quot; base to read every
                    message.

          P    Defines the QWK packet conference that this base is permanently
               assigned.  Normally when created, this will be equal to the
               base number.  If a base below this one is deleted however, the
               QWK replies will always be brought into this conference because
               of the permanent number.

     In addition, you can modify any of the entries shown on the screen.
     They are defined as:

          !    This option allows you to define the type and availability
               of the current protocol.  The available types are:

                    Active &#9472; The protocol is active

                    Batch &#9472; The protocol will transfer multiple files with
                         one command.

                    Resume &#9472; The protocol will transfer one file, and
                         resume the transfer where it left off (if the
                         previous transfer was aborted).

                    Bi&#9472;Directional &#9472; The protocol will transfer files in
                         both directions at the same time.

                    Reliable &#9472; The protocol should only be available to
                         those callers who connect with a reliable connection.
                         (Error Correction Connect...)

          1    This option defines the command keys required to select the
               protocol and a description that will be displayed when
               requested.

          2    This option defines the ACS requirements that the user must have
               to use the protocol.

          3    This option defines the name of the file that holds the
               result log of a file transfer operation.

          4    This option defines the names of the permanent result log
               files for upload and download transfers.

          5    This option defines the commands required to perform file
               uploading and downloading.

               When pressed, you will be asked which command (upload or
               download) to define.  You are then asked which type of command
               it will be.  The four different command types are as follows:

                    (C)ommand &#9472;&#9472; The entry is assigned to a special
                         function.
                         Ascii &#9472;&#9472; The selected file will be transferred to
                              the remote user via ASCII transfer.

                         Batch &#9472;&#9472; The entry will not actually transfer a
                              file, but instead will add the file to the
                              batch transfer queue.

                         Edit &#9472;&#9472; The selected file's directory entry is edited
                              and the information can be changed.

                         Next &#9472;&#9472; The selected file is skipped and the next
                              file is selected.

                         Quit &#9472;&#9472; The selection is cancelled.

                    (E)xternal &#9472;&#9472; Allows you to define the actual DOS
                         Commandline used with the protocol driver.  Refer to
                         the above list to determine the correct Commandline.

                    (O)ff &#9472;&#9472; Disables that particular function for the
                         protocol.

          6    This option toggles if the error result codes defined in option
               7 mean a good or bad transfer.

          7    This option defines the result codes (for both uploading and
               downloading) returned by the protocol driver after completing
               transmission of a file.

          E    This option defines the command that sets up an environment
               string for those programs that require environment variables to
               be set up in certain ways for a transfer log.  For example:
               &quot;SET DSZLOG=%T&quot; would set the DSZ.COM temporary result log
               filename to the name defined in option 3.  If no environment
               setup is necessary, this string should be set to NULL (&quot;&quot;).

               *IMPORTANT*:   If you define a command with this option, make
                              sure to define it in your AUTOEXEC.BAT FILE!

          I    This option defines the name of the file in which Renegade
               will store the filenames to be transferred in a batch
               transfer.

          C    This option defines the maximum number of characters allowed
               on the DOS Commandline.  (Default is 128, which is the normal
               allowable DOS size.)

          P    This option defines the positions, on a single line of the
               temporary result log, of the filename and return status of the
               transfer.

     In this list, &quot;NN&quot; is the command number, &quot;KK&quot; are the keys used to
     execute the command, &quot;Typ&quot; is the type of command it is, and &quot;Options&quot; is
     the command data.

               will use to display the menu commands on the menu:

               The first is shown up above; it is more concise, and takes up
               less space than the alternate one (which is more descriptive).

          (X)Menu data/command data display mode toggle &#9472; Toggles between
               the menu command list mode, and another, separate list of
               information about the menu.

     When you activate the (M)odify command, you will be asked which command
     to modify.  After you enter the command number, a menu like the following
     is displayed:

          1    This field stores a long description of the menu command.
               If the menu keys are &quot;GTITLE&quot;, this is the title.

          2    This field stores a shorter description of the menu command.

          3    This is the actual string that the user enters when he wants
               to execute the command.

               If the menu key is more than one character in length, and the
               first character of the menu key is not a slash character
               (&quot;/&quot;), the user must enter two slashes in a row (&quot;//&quot;), and then
               the rest of the command.

               If a command has the menu key &quot;FIRSTCMD&quot;, they will be
               executed first, before the user is able to enter any commands.

               If a command has the menu key &quot;EVERYTIME&quot;, the command
               will be executed everytime the prompt is displayed, and after
               the menu is displayed to non&#9472;expert mode users.

               If a command has the menu key &quot;GTITLE&quot;, the line in
               Long Description is displayed as another title.

               If a command has the menu key &quot;ENTER&quot;, the key to access the
               command will be the enter key.

               If a command has the menu key &quot; &quot; (space), the key to access
               the command will be the spacebar.

               If a command has the menu key UP&#9472;ARROW, DOWN&#9472;ARROW, LEFT&#9472;ARROW,
               or RIGHT&#9472;ARROW, the key to access the command will be the
               corresponding cursor key for menus that trap local and remote
               cursor key movement.

          4    This is the ACS requirement that the user must satisfy to use
               or see the command.

          5    This is the type of command to be executed.  A full description
               of all the possible types commands is in Chapter 11&#9472;D.  If you
               have &quot;GTITLE&quot; as the ACS, leave this blank.

          6    This string contains command&#9472;particular information.  If the
               command uses this line, a short description is with the
               command in Chapter 11&#9472;D.  If you have &quot;GTITLE&quot; as the ACS,
               this line is the color set for the options after the title.
               (Bracket Color;Command Color;Description Color.  (ie: 4;0;5),

          (D)on't center the menu titles &#9472; This tells Renegade to
               leave the menu titles uncentered.
               This only affects the titles at the top.

          1    This field contains the title(s) of the current menu.

          2    This command inputs the filenames which make up the menus of
               your menu system.  The generic menus are specified if you set
               the strings to null.

               The first filename is the normal menu display, and the
               second filename is the longer menu display.  If a &quot;@S&quot;
               occurs in either of these two filenames, it is replaced with
               the current user's SL.

          3    This field contains the menu prompt that is displayed before it
               will accept commands from the user.  It can be up to 120
               characters long.

          4    This is the ACS requirement that the user must have to use the
               menu.  If the user does not have access, they will be sent to
               the fallback menu.

          5    If a menu has a password attached to it and a user attempts
               to enter the menu, the menu will ask for the password.  If the
               entered password is incorrect, the user is sent to the fallback
               menu.

          6    This is a legal menu file which is loaded whenever the user
               does not have access to the current menu or if a menu error
               occurs.

          7    The help level setting that is forced when the user enters
               the menu.  The help levels are:

                    0 &#9472;&#9472; No help level forcing.
                    1 &#9472;&#9472; Expert level (only the prompt is shown).
                    2 &#9472;&#9472; Normal level (the short menu is displayed).
                    3 &#9472;&#9472; Novice level (the long menu is displayed).

          8    This entry includes all the information that is used to
               generate the generic menus.

                        C. Generic columns  :4
                          How many columns of commands there are.
                        1. Bracket color    :1
                          The color of the bracket around the command
                          letter.
                        2. Command color    :9
                          The color of the command letter inside the
                          brackets.
                        3. Description color:1
                          The color of the description of the command.
                        S. Show menu
                          Shows the short generic menu.

          9    There are several functions for each menu that may be
               flagged on or off:

                        (C)lear screen     (D)on't center titles

     When a user activates a menu command, Renegade executes all of the
     commands which have the command letters which were entered by the user.
     If two different commands both have the same command letters in them,
     both commands are executed in the order they are in the menu.

     When linking commands together, remember to put a description only on

               Automatic   : Automatic Validation will search all of
                             your filebases for unvalidated files and
                             validate them where they are found without

               If no &lt;path&gt; is given, the file is assumed to be located in the
               DATA directory.  If no &lt;.ext&gt; is given, Renegade will look for
               the standard extensions.  MCI Codes are allowed here, so, for
               example, you can display different ANSI files for different
               message bases.

               doesn't, &quot;:&quot; will be displayed.  If the password is entered
               incorrectly, [bad&#9472;message] will be displayed if it
               exists. (If entered incorrectly, any further linking is

          !    This determines whether or not the event is active.

          1    This describes the event.  (Up to 80 characters)

          2    This is the type of event that will be executed.  There are
               six choices:

                    ACS &#9472;&#9472; Enables only certain callers who have the correct
                         security settings to access the BBS at a certain time
                         of the day.

                    Chat &#9472;&#9472; Not implemented yet.

                    DOS &#9472;&#9472; Shells to the DOS level and executes files defined
                           in the Event Data.

                    External &#9472;&#9472; This requires a batch file for execution, which
                         is used to detect an ERRORLEVEL value.

                    Pack &#9472;&#9472; This event packs the message bases by removing
                         all deleted messages and adjusting the number of
                         messages in each base to conform to the maximum
                         limit set in the message base editor.

                    Sort &#9472;&#9472; This event sorts the file bases by scanning the
                         directories and sorting by name.

          3    This field will vary with the type of event being executed.

                    DOS &#9472;&#9472; The name of the program to be run.

                    External &#9472;&#9472; The ERRORLEVEL value to be used when the BBS
                         quits to DOS.

                    ACS &#9472;&#9472; The ACS setting that users must have.

                    All others &#9472;&#9472; Not used; the event data field will be
                         ignored.

          4    This is the time before an event that the BBS will become busy.
               If a user is online, their online time is adjusted for the
               event.

          5    This is the time of day that the particular scheduled event
               will occur.  It is defined in the 24&#9472;hour format.

          6    This field determines whether or not the modem will be made
               busy during the scheduled event.

          7    This tells if the event is &quot;Hard&quot; or &quot;Soft&quot;.  Hard events
               will make Renegade shorten a user's time online if it will
               keep them on longer then when the event will run.  Soft events
               wait for the user to logoff before the event is run.

          8    This field determines if the BBS should run the event if it
               missed it the last time it was supposed to be run.

          9    This field sets the number of days since the event was last
               run.

          A    These are the days of either the regular week, or the month,
               that the scheduled event will occur.

                    Weekly &#9472;&#9472; Event will occur at least once every week.  A
                    bar with the current days active will be displayed as
                    follows:

                              Current: SMTWTFS
                                      [       ]

                    Modify by entering &quot;X&quot;'s under the days the event is to be
                    active.

                    Monthly &#9472;&#9472; This will occur only one day in the month, and
                            is modified by entering the day it is to be run.

          B    This field determines which node will run the event.  0 means
               the first free node will run it.

          [    This will jump back one entry in the list of events.

          ]    This will move forward one entry in the list of events.

          F    This will move to the first entry in the list of events.

          L    This will move to the last entry in the list of events.

          J    This will jump to a specified entry in the list of events.

          Q    Saves all entries in the list of events and returns to the
               main editor screen.

 Chapter 15 - Mini-DOS Environment

        Mini&#9472;DOS is a small, compact version of the DOS Commandline.  When
        you enter this area, you will see something like:

          E:\RENEGADE&gt;

        where E:\RENEGADE is your BBS Home directory.  The commands available
        here are:


         CD            Normal DOS Change Directory Command

         CLS           Normal DOS Clear Screen Command

         CONVERT       This command will convert an archived file to another
                       archive format.  The proper format for the command is:

                       CONVERT FILENAME.EXT XTN

                       where FILENAME.EXT is the full drive:\path\filename
                       with the correct archive extension of the archive you
                       want to convert (ie: RENEGADE.ZIP).  XTN is the archive
                       extension that you want to convert the original file to
                       (ie: ARJ). The archive type you want to convert to
                       must be defined in the Archive Configuration.

         COPY          Normal DOS Copy Command.

         DEL           Normal DOS Delete Command.

         DIR           This command will provide a short DOS directory.  The
                        use is the same as the normal DOS Directory Command.

         DIRSIZE       This command will provide the amount of space that a
                       given filetype takes up.  The usage is:

                         DIRSIZE FILETYPE[.EXT]

                       FILETYPE is a valid DOS filename, EXT is an optional
                       extension.  Wildcards are allowed.

                       &quot;DIRSIZE *.ZIP&quot; shows the total size of all the ZIP
                       files, while &quot;DIRSIZE *&quot; will show the total size of
                       all the files that don't have an extension.

         DISKFREE      This command will show the amount of space free on the
                       current drive.

         EDIT          This command will pop up the old Renegade Editor, which
                       is not unlike the DOS command EDLIN.  If no file is
                       specified, the file is then asked for.

         EXT           This command will allow the command after it (ie:
                       EXT DIR) to pass to DOS directly, not relying on
                       MiniDOS. Be very careful of who has access to MiniDOS.
                       Anyone can use this command to format your harddrive,
                       deltree your root directory, or run a virus they've
                       just uploaded.

         EXIT          Normal DOS EXIT Command which will return you to
                       Renegade.

         HELP or ?     This command will up the DOSHELP.* file as a Help
                       me file.

         MD            Normal DOS Make Directory Command.

         MOVE          This command will copy a file or a group of files
                       and then will delete the original files.  The proper
                       format for this command is:

                         MOVE FILESPEC.EXT DESTINATION

         RD            Normal DOS Remove Directory Command.

         RECEIVE       This command will tell Renegade to receive a file from
                       the remote computer.  The full command is just
                       &quot;RECEIVE&quot;.  After pressing enter, Renegade will prompt
                       for a protocol, and if the protocol is a non&#9472;batch
                       protocol, Renegade will prompt for a filename.

         REN           Normal DOS Rename File Command.

         SEND          This command is the opposite of receive, as it will
                       allow the remote computer to receive a file that is
                       sent from Renegade.  No filespecs are required for the
                       command.  The filename is asked for and then the
                       protocol.

         TYPE          Normal DOS Type Command. (If in Renegade, you have a
                       page pause, the file you are typing will be paused.)

         UNZIP         This command will extract the files from an archive
                       file (Not just ZIP files, any archive type defined in
                       the Archive Configuration can be extracted with this
                       command). The proper format for this command is:

                         UNZIP FILENAME.EXT [OPTIONAL]

                       FILENAME.EXE is the FULL path and filename with
                       extension of the archive.  [OPTIONAL] is any optional
                       information that should be passed to the Un&#9472;Archiver,
                       such as destination, file to extract, etc. 

         VER           This command will just notify you that you are in the
                       Renegade DOS Emulator.

         VIEW         This command will use the Renegade Internal File lister
                      and will list the files inside an archive.  The proper
                      use for this command is:

                        INF FILENAME

                      VIEW will search for wildcards for the extension. In
                      order to see an archives interior with VIEW, that
                      archive type must have been defined in the Archive
                      Configuration.

                      NOTE: The default DOSHELP.ASC 

         ZIP           This command is the opposite of the UNZIP command.  It
                       has the same format however:

                         ZIP FILENAME.EXT FILE1.EXT [FILE2.EXT ...]

                       FILENAME.EXT is the full path and filename with
                       extension, FILE1.EXT is the full path and filename
                       for the first file to be archived.  [FILE2.EXT ...]
                       is any other files you want to stick in the archive.
                       The archive type you're compressing to must be defined
                       in the Archive Configuration.
                       
         &lt;X&gt;:          &lt;X&gt; = Drive Letter: Normal DOS Change Drive command.
                       ie - C: changes to the C drive, D: to the drive, and so
                       on.

     Infoform questionnaires are text files with certain commands that only
     have meaning to the BBS.  The questionnaire is stored in the MISC
     directory, in a file with the extension .INF, .INA or .INV (No Emulation,
     ANSI Emulation, or Avatar Emulation, respectively.)  When users answer
     the question(s), their answers are also stored in the MISC directory, in
     a file with the extension &quot;.ASW&quot;.  Answers from other users are appended
     to the end of the answer file.

     A special Infoform questionnaire called NEWUSER is always given to a new
     user during the new user logon process.  An example is listed below:

&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

Alright!  Only a few more questions to go before you can logon.  Please
answer the questions, as they are essential for Validation and just as a
security measure.  Don't worry though....  It's not a test. (it's a quiz..)

     but beginning with a &quot;:&quot; character, and are followed by a string of
     characters which define the label name.  Everything else is treated as
     straight text.  A &quot;; &lt;string&gt;&quot; line is treated as a comment.

          Command:  A&lt;string&gt;*

     Certain errors while Renegade is online cause it to exit back to DOS.
     Whenever this occurs, the screen image is sent to a file called
     ERROR.LOG in your main BBS directory, along with certain pieces of
     information such as the time, date, error number, BBS version, the user
     who was on and what baud rate they were on at.

     A message is also sent to the SysOp log, and the user's screen when a
     error occurs.  If a error does occur in Renegade, please report it to
     either your local support hub, or one of the Renegade Alpha sites.  Please

                v5&#9472;11 Exp, the OY command key has been removed. Copy the
                YOURINFO.ASC included in this archive to your MISC directory
                and change OY to &#9472;F in all your menus, and change #6. Options

     Renegade looks for certain extensions when displaying files out of the
MISC directory. Which file is displayed depends on the extension (.xxx) and
the users emulation. The extensions are defined as follows:

     ASC - This generally denotes a plain text file. It can contain color
           codes which are displayed to users in any emulation mode.

     ANS - This denotes a file saved in ANSI and will be displayed to users
           who have ANSI emulation or above.


 AN1&#9472;AN9 - If a file with the extension of .AN1 exists, Renegade will
           pick and display a random file. For example; During the logon
           sequence, WELCOME.ANS is displayed. If WELCOME.AN1 exists,
           Renegade will randomnly choose which file file to display.
           This can go on from AN1 to AN9, allowing you to define up to
           ten files (ANS counts as well) of which Renegade will choose
           and display one of them.

 A0S&#9472;A6S - These files are displayed on different days of the week, ranging
           from 0:Sunday to 6:Saturday.They can be used in conjunction with the
           random files, too. (WELCOME.A01 for example, means the first (1)
           random ANSI displayed on Sundays).

     AVT - This denotes a file saved in Avatar, and will be displayed to
           users who have Avatar emulation or above. If a user selects Avatar
           as their emulation, and no .AVT files exist, Renegade will fall
           back and display ANSI files instead. If no .ANS files are found,
           it will fall back to .ASC.

 AV1-AV9 - Avatar follows the same guidelines for random files that ANSI
           does, only with AV1-AV9 as the valid extensions.

     RIP - This extension denotes a file saved in RIP format (see Glossary
           of Terms). RIP files are forced to display, even in expert
           mode. If a user selects RIP as their emulation, and no .RIP
           files exist, it will fall back to Avatar, then Ansi, and then
           to .ASC if necessary.

 RI1-RI9 - RIP follows the same guidelines for random files that ANSI
           does, only with RI1-RI9 as the valid extensions.

Teleconference Notes: All of the commands in this section that have username
options (like /MSG, /EJECT, etc.) can have partial usernames. Ex: /PRIVATE Adr
will send a private message to an online user with A,d, and r as the first
part of their handle.

As of v98-101b, the Teleconference commands changed in syntax. They've been
expanded from their former single letter commands (/P to /PRIVATE for example).
The WHATSNEW wasn't entirely correct in the listed changes for Teleconference.
The following mistakes were made in the WHATSNEW regarding the changes to
Teleconferencing:

A) The maximum number of global channels is erroneously reported as 255.
The true maximum number is 32767.

B) The /REGISTRY command was omitted from the WHATSNEW, but is documented
below.

Global Channels:             You may or may not be wondering what a Global
                             Channel is. When you join a Global Channel
                             (1-32767), any message sent on that channel will
                             be displayed to everyone on the channel wherever
                             they are on the BBS (the exceptions are if a
                             member of the channel is in a Door or
                             transferring files, in which case the messages
                             will be displayed when the door is exited, or the
                             transfer complete). Global Messages are sent via
                             the /MSG command while in a chat room.

        The Teleconferencing Action File is a file named ACTIONS.LST in your
DATA directory which will have pre&#9472;defined actions like the &quot;/a&quot; command, but
without the &quot;/a&quot; use.

  The format is:

        [KEYWORD]
        [STRING SHOWN TO USER]
        [STRING SHOWN TO ALL BUT RECEIVER]
        [STRING SHOWS TO ALL IF THERE IS NO RECEIVER]
        [STRING SHOWN TO RECEIVER]

  The 2 MCI codes that are for this file only are %S and %R, which stand for
  Sender and Receiver, respectively.  A sample file:

        In these days of high speed modems, it goes without saying; Turn
        the Com Port locking on. It also goes without saying that you
        need a 16550 UART. :)

        Lock the Port at it's maximum baud rate in Renegade, as well
        as via your fossil driver (refer to your fossil drivers
        documentation for instructions on doing so). Be forewarned,
        when locking your port at 115200, there's a chance that
        some older doors won't work. They were originally programmed
        with 57600 as the highest baud rate, and the extra character
        will throw it off. I recommend setting 57600 as your locked
        rates in everything.

        This list of init strings is by no means comprehensive. If you

        For the Hayes 28.8, you have to program your modem's volatile

        to modem and enter:
                        AT&amp;F &lt;ENTER&gt;

        Also, this modem is extremely picky.. I have only been able

   Conferences can be a royal pain in the ass for the newbies to understand.
   The best way to explain how conferences work is by real-world example,
   so I'll be explaining them in terms of what I used them for on my own
   system.

   I'm a member of more than a few echomail networks. Not all of my users
   like to see everything I have available at one time, nor do they like
   scanning through an arealist of several hundred message bases just to
   find one in particular. My solution was to break them up into conferences.

   You have 27 conferences available to you; @,A-Z. Each one can be used
   to represent a category, a message network, or whatever you'd like.

   The first thing to do is define the conferences within the conference
   editor (see Chapter 14). My list looks something like this;

   Conference A - Local Message Bases
              B - FidoNet
              C - GuildeNet
              D - Paranor

  None of these contain material which I need to restrict from young
  or immature eyes, so all the above conferences have their ACS set to ^.

  Alright, so now I've defined the conferences. Big fragging deal, right? They
  don't do much but sit there. Conferences are actually part of the ACS
  System (see Chapter 3). Implementing a conference looks something like this:

Message base #189 of 193

1. Name        : [Fido] - Renegade Support
2. Filename    : RG
3. Base type   : EchoMail
   Message path: C:\REN\ECHO\RG\
4. ACS req.    : cB
5. Post/MCI ACS:  / %
6. Sysop ACS   : fM
7. Max Mess    : 300
8. Anonymous   : No
9. Password    :
N. Net Address : 1:133/1004
C. Colors      : Text=4, Quote=3, Tear=3, Origin=4
M. Mail flags  : -S-/T-
O. Origin line : The Holy Church of Tremere
T. Toggles     : R----
P. QWK Index   : 182
Q. Quit

  Note option #4, ACS required. As per defined in Chapter 3, the c portion
  means conference, and the letter following is which conference the user
  must be in for access. So for this message base, a user must be in
  conference B in order to see the message base. Local Message Bases would
  receive an ACS of cA, GuildeNet would receive cC, and so on until all
  message bases and defined conferences are accounted for.

  The procedure is basically the same if you want to split your filebases
  into conferences.

  Okay, so now your message bases are all categorized. Next problem; there
  are only two Join Conference commands present on the system; one on the
  Main Menu, one on the Message Menu. Your users probably don't have a clue
  that you've switched to a conferencing system, so they're probably getting
  lost trying to find their favorite message base. The solution? Add a
  'Join Which Conference?' prompt to the message newscanning process.

  The first thing to do towards accomplishing this is to load up the menu
  editor, load the Main Menu, and then locate the command that initiates
  the Message newscan. Insert something that looks like the following
  directly (sequentially) in front of the message newscan command:

Menu filename: MAIN
Command #12 of 30

1. Long descript :
2. Short descript:
3. Menu keys     :M
4. ACS required  :&quot;&quot;
5. Cmdkeys       :OR
6. Options       :
   Flags         :None
Q. Quit

  There's an important concept here; command stacking. Note option 3,
  Menu Keys. You already have a command defined for Menu Key M, the message
  newscanning command. Now you're adding OR (which means Change Conference).
  What happens if two or more commands use the same Menu key within the same
  menu?

  All occurances of the same Menu Key execute in the sequential order that
  they appear within the menu.

  Now, in English; let's say Command #2 on the Main Menu uses Menu Key M.
  Now let's say that so does Main Menu Command #37. If this were
  the case, then when M is pressed from the main menu, command #2 would
  execute and then command #37 would execute immediately afterwards. The user
  would press one key, yet execute two commands.

  So, now you've added the above command so that it appears in front of
  the message newscanning command. What happens when you save this menu,
  logon, and press M from the Main Menu?

  You're prompted to join a conference, and then asked if you want to scan
  for new messages, just like normal.

  Now those conferences you defined back at the beginning of this section
  actually mean something! The message bases are categorized, your users
  are praising your efforts, and there is Joy in Mudville.

  Next Concept: Global Conference

  Remember how I said above that some users don't want to see everything
  all at once, that they don't like to be deluged with hundreds of message
  bases at once? Well, believe it or not, there are some users who actually
  *do* want to see everything all at once. They become very annoyed at having
  to change back and forth between conferences in order to make sure they
  don't miss anything. What's a poor sysop to do?

  This is where a Global Conference comes into play. The first thing to
  do is select an unused conference to fill the role. I use Conference Z,
  so now my conference list looks something like this:

   Conference A - Local Message Bases
              B - FidoNet
              C - GuildeNet
              D - Paranor
              Z - Join All Conferences

  I still have nothing to hide from the users, so each defined Conference ACS
  remains at ^.

  Now for the implementation:

1. Name        : [Fido] - Renegade Support
2. Filename    : RG
3. Base type   : EchoMail
   Message path: C:\REN\ECHO\RG\
4. ACS req.    : cB|cZ

  Note the change in ACS requirements; instead of cB, it's now cB|cZ. The
  | separating the two ACS codes means 'or' (See Chapter 3). So in order
  to see this message base, a user would have to be in either conference
  B or in conference Z. All FidoNet bases would get this ACS, while the
  Local Message Bases get cA|cZ, GuildeNet gets cC|cZ, et al.

  Of course, you could just tell the I-wanna-see-everything masochists
  to frag off and live with it. ;)

   Doors are among the easiest things to setup once you figure out how.
   It's while gaining the knowhow that confusion sometimes results (I've
   lost count of how many times I've been asked for a copy of my DOOR.SYS)

   First, you should understand what a door is; it's a third party program
   designed to do something specific (whether it be a game, a user registry, 
   or an offline mail door) that runs independently of the BBS. In order
   to run correctly, the BBS and the Door need to have some common form
   of communication; this is done via dropfiles. A dropfile is something
   generated by the BBS. The BBS puts important stuff like the online
   users name, which com port they're connect on, and how much time they have
   left online into the dropfile. A dropfile is dynamic, and it can change
   several times in the course of a single call. Basically, the BBS takes a
   look at the current state of things, dumps that info into the dropfile,
   then lets the Door take over. The Door reads the dropfile, gets what info
   it needs, and then does whatever it was programmed to do. When the Door is
   done doing it's thing, it turns control back over to the BBS.

   Each door wants to be setup in it's own special way. Some are fairly simple
   and some can drive a sysop to fits of mad rage. It would be impossible to
   give an all-knowing account of how to setup every kind of door known to
   sysop. There is a general formula, however. The first and most important
   thing is to figure out which dropfile format the door supports. Renegade
   and the Door must support a common format, otherwise you cannot use
   the door.

   Renegade supports the following dropfile types:

   DOOR.SYS,DORINFO1.DEF,SFDOORS.DAT,CALLINFO.BBS,PCBOARD.SYS, and CHAIN.TXT

   Most modern doors support DOOR.SYS and/or DORINFO1.DEF. If you're given
   a choice of formats, use DOOR.SYS whenever possible.

   The next thing that needs to be figured out is where in bog's name is
   Renegade creating the dropfile? Each node has to set it's dropfile path
   via the Modem/Node Configuration (See Chapter 6-B). If it's not
   defined, the dropfile *should* be created in the main Renegade directory
   (which for the rest of this example, will be C:\RG).

   For simplicity's sake, we'll assume the drop file is being created in
   C:\RG.

   Usurper is my door of choice for the following example.

   Some doors are picky, they like the dropfiles to be present in the
   same directory that the door is being run from. Usurper is one of
   these; that means I have to get the dropfile from Renegade's main
   directory to Usurper's directory. Batch File time.

--Begin USURP.BAT--
@echo off
cd\door\usurper
copy c:\rg\door.sys
usurper
cd\rg
--End USURP.BAT--

  This copies the DOOR.SYS to Usurpers directory, and then runs the game.
  Note: Some doors are nice. They have configuration programs that will
  ask you where the dropfile is, and then they'll look for it in whatever
  directory you pointed it towards. Again, it's important to stress that
  each door has it's own way of working. Some you're going to have to
  fiddle with in order to get working, and gods forbid you ever have to
  worry about setting a door up for multinode use.

  Okay, now to actually make the BBS run the game. :) First things first;
  By this time I've read through Usurpers documentation and I'm sure I've
  got it configured correctly. After that, I add the menu command to
  invoke it. The command looks something like this:

Menu filename: ONLINE
Command #12 of 30

1. Long descript :(1) Usurper
2. Short descript:(1) Usurper
3. Menu keys     :1
4. ACS required  :&quot;&quot;
5. Cmdkeys       :DG
6. Options       :c:\rg\usurp.bat
   Flags         :None
Q. Quit

  The Menu Key is 1; that means I press 1 in order to run this command.
  The CmdKey is DG, which tells Renegade to generate a DOOR.SYS. (For the
  full list of which CmdKeys generate which dropfiles, refer to Chapter
  11-D-7) The option tells Renegade what to run in order to load the door.

  The overall effect works something like this; I press 1, Renegade generates
  DOOR.SYS in it's main directory and then runs usurp.bat. If everything is
  configured correctly, Usurper comes up, I spend 15 minutes committing vile
  acts of darkness, the BBS reloads, and I find another game to play.

                                 What You Need
                                 -------------

    Before you begin, there are two things you will need:

    1.  Ray Gwinn's superb fossil driver, SIO.  It can found on any good
    OS/2 BBS or at the author's world wide web site at
    http://www.gwinn.com.  It can also be obtained from my system via File
    REQuest as SIO.  As of this writing, the latest version is v1.60d.  SIO
    is Shareware.

    2. A program to free up &quot;time slices&quot; for OS/2 while Renegade is idle.
    I use and highly recommend Tame, by David G. Thomas.  It can be found
    on the InterNet at ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/dos/tame333.zip.  It can
    also be found at any good OS/2 BBS, including mine, requestable as
    TAME.  As of this writing, the latest version is 3.33.  Tame is
    Shareware.


                             General Tips and FYI
                             --------------------

    Following are some basic tips on how OS/2 functions and how to improve
    its performance:


    - OS/2 has a CONFIG.SYS and an AUTOEXEC.BAT just like DOS.

      However, the CONFIG.SYS is used exclusively for OS/2 applications.
      OS/2 apps do NOT see any of the settings in the AUTOEXEC.BAT!

      The AUTOEXEC.BAT is used exclusively for DOS applications.  This is
      very convenient for DOS applications, because if they require changes
      in the AUTOEXEC.BAT, you do not have to reboot for the changes to
      take effect.  Simply make the changes, exit the DOS session, and open
      a new one!  Programs such as device drivers for DOS applications can
      be loaded in the DOS_DEVICE settings for the app (see below).


    - If configured properly, device drivers for OS/2 sessions also apply
      to DOS sessions.  For example, if you can use your mouse in an OS/2
      session, you can probably use it in a DOS session without having to
      load a mouse driver.  The same goes for CDROMs and network drivers.


    - File sharing capabilities are part of OS/2.  It does not require
      SHARE.EXE to be loaded.


    - OS/2's method of undeleting files requires the environment variable
      DELDIR to be set.  DOS undelete programs sometimes work on FAT
      partitions, but they do not work on HPFS partitions.


    - If you are unsure what an OS/2 command or error message means, type
      &quot;help &lt;error&gt;&quot; or &quot;help &lt;command&gt;&quot; for help on that command.  This
      is useful for unspecific error messages and for finding out what
      all those commands mean in your config.sys.  :)


    - By default, OS/2 verifies the writing of every file to your drive.
      This is secure, yes, but time consuming, especially for disk
      intensive applications, such as mail tossing.  I recommend turning
      off VERIFY for atleast your mail tossing batch files.


    - The DELDIR environment variable slows down mail tossing as well.
      I suggest making sure DELDIR is not set for your mail tossing batch
      files.


    - DOS batch files have the extension .BAT.
      OS/2 batch files have the extension .CMD.

      If a .CMD file starts with &quot;/*&quot;, OS/2 considers it a REXX program,
      and will not treat it as a normal batch file.


    - OS/2 batch programming is the same as DOS batch programming.


    - High Performance File System (HPFS) drives are much faster and
      more reliable than File Allocation Table (FAT) drives.  HPFS
      drives can be accessed from all sessions under OS/2.  However,
      without the use of a third party driver, HPFS drives can not be
      accessed when running straight DOS.

      With that in mind, if you are planning on running OS/2 most of the
      time, you might want to consider using an HPFS partition and leave
      a small FAT partition for when you need to use DOS.

      Also keep in mind that HPFS requires more memory than FAT.


    - All programs, especially mail tossing programs, love a disk cache.
      OS/2's FAT cache is defined in the CONFIG.SYS with the &quot;DISKCACHE&quot;
      line.  OS/2 HPFS cache is defined with the CACHE statement, usually
      located right after your HPFS driver (usually at the top of your
      CONFIG.SYS).

      The FAT cache is limited to 7 megs and the HPFS cache is limited
      to 2 megs.


    - You want be careful with using the command EXIT in batch files.  It
      will close the session, whether it be OS/2 or DOS!  In some cases,
      this is desirable.  In most, it is not!


                                      SIO
                                      ---

    I *HIGHLY* recommend atleast browsing the documentation for SIO before
    continuing.  However, the documentation may be a bit overwhelming at
    first, especially for the novice.  So I am including the basics
    required to get SIO installed and working properly.

    First, extract the SIO archive into a directory of its own.  Then run
    INSTALL.  The installation program will locate and REM out the lines in
    your CONFIG.SYS that load the default COM drivers and insert two lines
    that will load SIO.

    In most cases, this is all you need to install SIO.  However, in some
    instances, SIO may not work properly without a little intervention
    on your part.

    So, after installing SIO, close all your programs and shutdown and
    restart OS/2.  While OS/2 is booting up, watch for the SIO logo and
    take note what messages it displays.  It should display what COM ports
    it found and loaded support for, and if you have a serial mouse, it
    should say &quot;Not using COM port - the mouse has it&quot; for that COM port.

    If SIO did not detect everything, or you want to configure SIO further,
    edit your CONFIG.SYS and locate the following lines:

    DEVICE=&lt;directory&gt;\SIO.SYS
    DEVICE=&lt;directory&gt;\VSIO.SYS


    If SIO did not detect everything or install properly:

    - Verify the lines for COM.SYS and VCOM.SYS have been REMed out.

    - If you have a serial mouse, and SIO did not detect it, verify the
      VMOUSE.SYS, POINTDD.SYS, and MOUSE.SYS are located in your CONFIG.SYS
      *ABOVE* the lines for SIO.  Be careful not to change the order of
      these three drivers!  If they are loaded in the wrong order, you will
      loose your mouse support!

    - If you have a COM port SIO did not detect, it is probably because the
      port is on a &quot;non-standard&quot; IRQ and address.  To tell SIO where it
      is, add this to the &quot;SIO.SYS&quot; line:

      (COMx,ADDRESS,IRQy)

      Where COMx is the COM port, address is the Hex address for the port,
      and IRQy is the IRQ for the port.  Example:

      DEVICE=c:\sio\sio.sys (COM3,3E8,IRQ2)

      would tell SIO to look for COM3 at IRQ 2, address 3E8.


    If you want SIO to lock your ports to a certain rate:

    - Add a colon after the COMx entry followed by the locked rate.
      Example:

      DEVICE=c:\sio\sio.sys (COM1:57600)


    By default, once a session is using a COM port, another session can NOT
    access it.  To configure SIO to allow multiple access to the COM port:

    - Add a dash (-) in the fourth parameter for that COM port.
      Example:

      DEVICE=c:\sio\sio.sys (COM1,,,-)


    For further information on SIO, please refer to SIOUSER.TXT and
    SIOREF.TXT included in the SIO distribution archive.


                                     TAME
                                     ----

    TAME's primary function is to force Renegade to release CPU cycles to
    the system when Renegade is idle so that other programs can run
    normally.

    TAME has a *LOT* of configuration options, and it is easy to be
    overwhelmed by them all.  The basic options are all that are needed, as
    I will show.

    First, atleast browse the TAME documentation.

    Second, add the following line to your batch file(s) that load
    Renegade:

    &lt;pathname&gt;\TAME /I &lt;1, 5, or 9&gt;

    The higher the number is, the more aggressive TAME will be on Renegade.
    I suggest starting at 5, and if you find that Renegade is running fine,
    but everything else slows down, change it to 9.  If 5 makes Renegade
    too slow, change it to 1.

    And that's it! :)

    For further information on TAME, please see TAME.DOC in the TAME
    distribution archive.


                             The Work Place Shell
                             --------------------

    OS/2 Warp by default uses a program called the Work Place Shell (WPS),
    which is basically your desktop.  It allows you to have icons,
    dragging and dropping icons, and quite a bit a more.

    It, however, also uses a *LOT* of memory!

    So, if you do not have atleast 16 megs of memory, I recommend you use a
    replacement shell, such as FileBar by Eric A. Wolf.  It is not as
    pretty, nor does it allow as many options as the WPS does.  But it uses
    significantly less memory, and, on low memory environments, it will
    improve performance immensely!

    Filebar can be found on the InterNet at at any good OS/2 BBS (including
    mine :), requestable as FILEBAR.  It can also be found on the InterNet
    at ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/shell/fileb205.zip.  As of this
    writing, the latest version is 2.05.  Filebar is Shareware.

    I am including instructions for settings up Renegade using both the WPS
    and Renegade.


                              If You Use the WPS
                              ------------------

    The first thing you need is an icon for Renegade.  To create an icon,
    open your templates folder.  Find the &quot;Program&quot; icon, right click on
    it, and drag a copy of it to your desktop.  Once you &quot;drop&quot; it, the
    properties for your new Icon will display for you to configure.

    In the path and filename field, type in the path and filename of the
    batch file you use to run Renegade, or the path to your RENEGADE.EXE if
    that is how you run it.

    If you need to include parameters for the filename, place them in the
    &quot;Parameters&quot; field.  You can set the &quot;Working directory&quot; to your
    Renegade directory, or your mailer directory (if you use a mailer), or
    you can just leave it blank.

    At this point, click on the &quot;Session&quot; tab on the right side of the
    &quot;Program - Settings&quot; window.  OS/2 should automatically detect that
    the program is a DOS program, and it will gray out non-applicable
    options.

    Renegade runs best in a DOS fullscreen (but it can be run in a window),
    so choose &quot;DOS Fullscreen&quot;.  Then click on the &quot;DOS Settings&quot; button.
    Click on the &quot;okay&quot; to list all DOS settings.

    You should now see a very long list of DOS settings.  One of the great
    things about OS/2 is you can customize settings to the extreme.
    However, for the novice, it can be very overwhelming.  So I'm just
    going to list those that are relevant and their associated settings.
    You will probably need to fine tune these for your system, since every
    system is different.  But this will provide a good start for you.

    DOS_AUTOEXEC
         - The batch file you use to run Renegade.
    DOS_BACKGROUND_EXECUTION
         - On.
    DOS_BREAK
         - On.
    DOS_DEVICE
         - You want two items:

           &lt;path to OS/2&gt;\mdos\ansi.sys
           &lt;path to SIO&gt;\vx00.sys

           The former is the ANSI driver and the latter is the fossil
           emulator for Renegade.
    DOS_FILES
         - Set to atleast 40.
    DOS_HIGH
         - On.
    DOS_UMB
         - On.
    EMS_MEMORY_LIMIT
         - Set to 512 if you have memory to spare and you have Renegade set
           to use it's overlay in EMS.
    IDLE_SECONDS
         - This needs customized for your system.  I suggest 30, but I have
           mine set to 60.  If Renegade seems &quot;jerky&quot; and does not respond
           well, this may be too low.
    IDLE_SENSITIVITY
         - This too needs customized for your system.  I suggest 50, which
           is what I use.  If Renegade is not responding well, this may be
           too low.
    INT_DURING_IO
         - On.
    SESSION_PRIORITY
         - 32.  If this causes the rest of your system to slow down
           noticably, set it to a lower value.
    SIO_Allow_Access_COMx
         - Turn on for the COM port Renegade will be using.
           Turn off for the COM ports it will not be.
    SIO_Idle_Sensitivity
         - This needs customized for your system.  I suggest starting at 50
           and start lowering it.  If your ANSI screens start slowing down,
           it may be too low.  I have mine at 30.
    VIDEO_FASTPASTE
         - On. This will help for pasting to Renegade from the clipboard.
    XMS_MEMORY_LIMIT
         - Set to atleast 1024.  Use 2048 if you have memory to spare.
           This and EMS_MEMORY_LIMIT may need customized if you have door
           programs that like specific types of memory available.

    Now click on &quot;save&quot; to save the settings.

    Now click on the &quot;General&quot; tab on the right to bring up the &quot;General&quot;
    settings.

    You can now name your icon.  If this will be the only Renegade node,
    you might want to just call it &quot;Renegade&quot;.  If it is going to be one of
    multiple nodes, call it &quot;Renegade Node #1&quot;.  If you are going to use
    multiple nodes, put a check mark in &quot;template&quot;.  Once it is a template
    you can drag copies off of it, like you did to create this, and it will
    have the exact same settings.  You will only have to change the
    filenames, the name of the icon, and the DOS_AUTOEXEC setting.

    Now double click the upper left-hand corner of the settings window to
    close the window.

    If you want Renegade to start automatically upon bootup, locate your
    startup folder and drag and drop the Renegade icon into it.


                              If You Use FileBar
                              ------------------

    The first thing you need to decide is what menu bar you will put
    Renegade in.  I made a menu bar called &quot;DOS Programs&quot; for it and all
    other DOS programs I readily access.

    Now that you have decided, click on FileBar (left side) and choose
    &quot;Edit Menus.  Navigate to the menu you want to add Renegade to, and
    click &quot;Add Item&quot;.

    (Please note that it is easier to navigate this configuration screen
    with a mouse than it is with the tab keys.)

    Give it a name, such as &quot;Renegade&quot;, if you are only running one node,
    or &quot;Renegade Node #1&quot; if you running multinode.  Renegade runs best in
    a full screen (but it will run windowed), so choose &quot;DOS FS&quot; under
    &quot;Item Session Type&quot;.  In &quot;Pgm Path&quot;, put the complete path and filename
    to Renegade, or the batch file you use to run Renegade.  Set
    &quot;Directory&quot; to the directory name of the batch file.  In &quot;Settings&quot;,
    type in the path name you put in &quot;Pgm Path&quot; followed by a filename with
    the extension .CFG, such as RG01.CFG.  (Eg: &quot;d:\renegade\rg01.cfg&quot;).
    Click on &quot;Settings&quot; to bring up the DOS settings.

    Click on &quot;Okay&quot; to bring up all the settings.

    You should now see a very long list of DOS settings.  One of the great
    things about OS/2 is you can customize settings to the extreme.
    However, for the novice, it can be very overwhelming.  So I'm just

           noticably, set it to a lower value.
    SIO_Allow_Access_COMx
         - Turn on for the COM port Renegade will be using.
           Turn off for the COM ports it will not be.
    SIO_Idle_Sensitivity
         - This needs customized for your system.  I suggest starting at 50
           and start lowering it.  If your ANSI screens start slowing down,
           it may be too low.  I have mine at 30.
    VIDEO_FASTPASTE
         - On. This will help for pasting to Renegade from the clipboard.
    XMS_MEMORY_LIMIT
         - Set to atleast 1024.  Use 2048 if you have memory to spare.
           This and EMS_MEMORY_LIMIT may need customized if you have door
           programs that like specific types of memory available.

    Click on &quot;Save&quot; to save the settings.  The settings are now saved in
    the file you set above in the &quot;Settings&quot; field.  If you need to modify
    them at a later date, it may be easier just to edit that file with a
    text editor.

    You should now be back at the &quot;Edit Item Data&quot; screen.  If you want
    this node of Renegade to start up automatically, I suggest putting a
    check mark in &quot;Launch Item At Start&quot;.  Now click on &quot;Okay&quot; to finish
    the settings.

    If you want to create a menu item for another node of Renegade, copy
    the item you just made (from the menu you are now at) and modify it to
    make all necessary changes.  I suggest copying the configuration file
    (which you defined in the &quot;Settings&quot; field) that you specified for the
    previous node and use the copy for this new node so that you have a
    different .CFG file for every node.


                            Creating a Telnet Node
                            ----------------------

    Making a Renegade node accessable via the InterNet through Telnet is
    extremely simple with OS/2 and SIO.  Actually, SIO deserves most of the
    credit, because it comes with a program called VMODEM that does all the
    hard work.

    What VMODEM does is emulates a COM port over a Telnet connection.

    The only requirements are having an InterNet PPP connection and a
    &quot;free&quot; COM port in your SIO configuration.

    What I mean by a &quot;free&quot; COM port is that the unregistered version of
    SIO only supports four COM ports.  You need to have SIO emulate another
    COM port, and this takes up one of the four ports SIO supports.

    To set SIO to emulate a COM port, add the following parameter to your
    SIO.SYS line in your CONFIG.SYS:

    (COMx,INTERNET:ADDRESS,NONE:IRQ)

    Where COMx is the COM port you want SIO to emulate, ADDRESS is the
    address you want SIO to emulate, and IRQ is the IRQ you want SIO to
    emulate.  Example:

    (COM4,INTERNET:2E8,NONE:10)

    This will cause SIO to create a virtual COM4 that is available at
    address 2E8, IRQ 10.

    All you have to do is tell Renegade to access that COM port for that
    node, set the address and IRQ in the modem configuration, and you will
    be good to go!  You can also run a mailer on this &quot;virtual&quot; COM port as
    well.

    Note that this COM port is *ALWAYS* locked at 57600.

    Configuring OS/2 to access the InterNet for a PPP connection is beyond
    the scope of this documentation.  However, feel free to Netmail me if
    you need assistance with your configuration.


                              Transfer Protocols
                              ------------------

    The &quot;standard&quot; transfer protocol that is used with Renegade is DSZ.

    DSZ is an excellent program - however it has one flaw.

    It was designed to run in a single task DOS environment.

    Under OS/2, DSZ is a CPU hog and it will make everything else crawl
    while someone is transferring a file.

    The only solution to this is to use another transfer protocol.

    Fortunately, the company that designed DSZ created another transfer
    protocol that works very well under OS/2 called FDSZ, which is designed
    to use a FOSSIL driver.  It is a &quot;prototype&quot;, but I have never had a
    problem with it.  It can be FREQ from my system, magic name FDSZ.

    There are differences between FDSZ and DSZ.  These include the F, D,
    handshake, and off commands, (The d (lower case) command is supported.)
    P, S, and Y parameters.  The port command takes a number only.
    Otherwise, functionality is similar to DSZ.EXE.

    Here is my protocol configuration using FDSZ:

    XModem upload: fdsz %P rx %F
    XModem dnload: fdsz %P sx %F
    YModem upload: fdsz %P rb -k %F
    YModem dnload: fdsz %P sk -k %F
    ZModem upload: fdsz %P rz -m %F
    ZModem dnload: fdsz %P sz -m %F
    ZModem batchU: fdsz %P restrict rz -m
    ZModem batchD: fdsz %P -m @%D (note that it will appear as @D)

    FDSZ has minimal (virtually 0) CPU usage on my system.


 *Note*  : Speaking only for myself, I use GSZ from Omen Technologies for my
           transfer protocols. While most people will tell you that GSZ is
           just a graphical version of DSZ, I've found that using it under
           OS/2 does not lag my system. There is one further advantage,
           GSZ uses the same commandlines that DSZ does. When I changed from
           DSZ to GSZ, all I did was rename GSZ.EXE to DSZ.COM. This saved me
           the time of having to manually edit all of my defined dsz protocols
           to say GSZ instead. -K. Reaverson


                             Running OS/2 Programs
                             ---------------------

    32-bit OS/2 programs run significantly faster than their 16-bit DOS or
    32-bit DOS counterparts.  With this in mind, you may want to use an
    OS/2 program in conjunction with Renegade.

    But you are probably wondering &quot;How can I do that when Renegade is a
    DOS program and OS/2 programs do not run from DOS sessions?&quot;

    One option is to use a program by Hank Kelder called HSTART.  HSTART
    can spawn OS/2 and DOS windows from OS/2 and DOS windows.  You can
    obtain HSTART off of the InterNet at ftp://hobbes.nmsu.edu in
    /pub/os2/util/system/hstart05.zip.  You can also FREQ it from my system
    as HSTART05.ZIP.

    HSTART comes with a utility called HWAIT which allows simple
    &quot;signalling&quot; between sessions.  HWAIT can be used to send a signal to
    HSTART or to another HWAIT that is waiting for a signal.  HWAIT can
    also be used to wait for a signal from another HWAIT.  The signals can
    be named or unnamed.

    To use HSTART and HWAIT the most efficient way, place them in a
    directory in both your OS/2 path and DOS path.


    With that in mind, generally there are three ways HSTART is used in a
    DOS session:

    1) To spawn an OS/2 application from a DOS session and the DOS session
       continues without pause.

    2) To spawn an OS/2 application from a DOS session and pause the DOS
       session until an unnamed HWAIT signal is received from the spawned
       session.

    3) To spawn an OS/2 application from a DOS session and pause the DOS
       session until a named HWAIT signal is received from the spawned
       session.

    Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.  Therefore one may be
    preferred over another, depending upon the situation.  Here are
    examples for each method:


    1) Whenever Renegade exits and there is unsent mail, you want to
       automatically spawn an OS/2 session to run your OS/2 native mail
       processing sequence (such as CDRMAIL/2 and FastEcho/2).  In this
       case, your batch file would have lines similar to this in it:

       &lt;export mail sequence&gt;
       hstart /FS c:\batch\scanmail.cmd
       &lt;continue batch file&gt;


    2) You want to run the OS/2 version of a door program.  In this case,
       you do not want the DOS session to continue until the OS/2 session
       is complete.  You only one run node, so there is no possibility of
       another node running the same door and getting their signals
       crossed.  Your batch file that Renegade calls would include a line
       similar to this:

       hstart /FS /WAIT c:\batch\lod.cmd


       The batch file &quot;lod.cmd&quot; would have:

       cd \doors\lod
       lod.exe &lt;parameters&gt;
       hwait
       exit


    3) Same scenario as above, except you are running a multinode system.
       Your batch file that Renegade calls would include something similar
       to this:

       hstart /FS c:\batch\lod.cmd
       hwait /w:lod


       The batch file &quot;lod.cmd&quot; would have:

       cd \doors\lod
       lod.exe &lt;parameters&gt;
       hwait /s:lod
       exit

       For named signals for multinode systems, you might want to have
       Renegade pass the node # that is calling to the batch file,
       and have the node # as part of the name for the signal.  Just
       remember you will also have to pass that node # to the batch file
       that is being called so that hwait can send the properly named
       signal.


    Please note that is easiest to have hstart spawn a batch file instead
    of the program directly, and that the path to the batch file is usually
    required.  When HSTART spawns a session, it searches the root directory
    of your boot drive, and then the PATH, for the file it is spawning.  It
    does not search the path HSTART is called from unless that path is in
    the PATH statement!

    For further details on HSTART and HWAIT, please refer to the
    documentation included in the distribution archive for HSTART.

Edit the dos properties of the batch file that runs the board to:
-background suspend DISABLED 
-idle sensitivity to the lowest setting   
-allow screen saver DISABLED

This is to keep win95 from declaring the board dead when it's not the window 
currently in focus.

Then, edit the properties of a normal ms-dos session to:
-background suspend ENABLED
-idle sensitivity to the highest setting
-screen saver ENABLED

This is to keep any dos boxes you've got running in the background from 
slowing down the board too much when you're not actively using it.

If you don't have a bajillion megs of ram, I'd suggest setting your desktop
background to a plain colour instead of an image, because the image takes up a
chunk o' memory. 

I wouldn't want to run rg multinode under win95 because rg single node is
pretty damned slow already.. and this is on a p150 w/ 16 megs of ram, 
dedicated most of the time. Sad, eh? =) Also, whichever &lt;or both&gt; of the 
instances of intermail or what have was not the currently focused on window 
would get short shrift as far as resources go. Win95 doesn't offer any easy 
way to configure a dos session even to the extent that desqview does.

Now, if you can live without the start button and that pesky explorer, you can
speed things up a bit:

open up the SYSTEM.INI file in your windows directory in a text editor. 
change the SHELL= line to say command.com instead of explorer.exe. (you can 
use the /k switch here if you like..  if you have anything you just can't
live without in your startup folder now, you might want to make a batch file
that runs 'em all and use the /k switch to run that batch file, because when 
using this shell, your startup folder will be ignored on startup.)

What you will see when you next boot [after anything you specified with /k is 
done running first] is your usual desktop background, with no icons and no 
taskbar. Doubleclick on the background to bring up the task manager. From 
there I'd suggest selecting run from the file menu, and running &quot;desktop&quot;, 
which will bring up a window with all your old desktop icons in it. What I did
was make a shortcut to the c:\windows\Start Menu folder in my desktop folder 
so I could access all the programs that were formerly on the start menu
relatively painlessly.  You can navigate this shell using the familiar old
short-cut keys: alt+tab to switch windows, alt+f4 to close a window, &amp;c. &amp;c.
One irritating thing about this shell is that it's hard to find some system 
dialogues that you would normally access by right clicking on things, but you 
can get around this by choosing 'see help index' from the desktop window and 
searching for the subject you're looking for.. usually the help for that topic
will have a nice polite hypertext link to the dialogue you want.

This seems like a lot of trouble to go through, but it's worth it in that what
you now have is a fast multitasker that runs dos and win95 programs, that is 
without the overhead and occasional bugs of explorer and the taskbar, and 
which, while obviously not as fast as a desqview setup would be on the same 
machine, will run a lot of programs, especially tossers, faster with win95's 
improvements on smartdrive. 

To run your board you should still use the modified properties you
hypothetically set up way at the beginning of this message instead of just 
running your board from a normal dos box, because you'll still have the one 
major drawback of win95, the allocation of the lion's share of resources to 
the active window.

in conclusion: use os/2 or desqview for less pain and more speed, but if you
want to continue running win95 only programs (or just 16 bit win programs in
native windows instead of an emu..) without having to reboot and use lilo or
system commander or whatever, follow these steps to make it less painful for
remote users, or even just to allow the board to run at all.  Changing your
shell to command.com is completely optional, but your users will thank you.
Well, no they won't, users could find ways to complain about speed even if
you were running on a dedicated p3000 system with 128 megs of ram, but it'll
be faster, trust me.  =) Don't even THINK about multinode unless you have
MORE than 32 megs of ram and don't plan on using any other programs than the
two instances of your mailer in the background.

 Glossary of Terms

      ANSI - Short for American National Standards Institute, in BBS slang
             it's a format for saving files. The format was adopted by ANSI
             as it's standard, and the format acquired the name of the
             organization as a result.

    CTS/RTS - Short for Clear to Send/Request to Send, respectively. Also
              known as Hardware Flow Control.

       DOS - Short for Disk Operating System. Usually preceeded by a prefix
             of some sort. MS-DOS is Microsoft DOS, published by Microsoft,
             PC-DOS is IBM's commercial version of DOS.

     Local - From the SysOp's point of view, any system which is accessed
             by basically sitting down in front of it. Everything else is
             remote. The computer he runs his BBS off of is the Local
             Computer. The Local Computer's screen is the local display,
             anything typed on the Local Computer's keyboard is local input.

    Newbie - Slang for novice; sometimes used interchangeably with the word
             clueless. Sometimes used as a derogative, other times as friendly
             chiding (depends on the person saying it). In general, it denotes
             a person new to the hobby, and therefore not yet familiar with
             most of it's aspects.

        OS - Short for Operating System.

      OS/2 - Short for Operating System/2, a commercial operating system
             created by IBM.

    Remote - Not on the local computer; If a user sits down in front of
             their computer and dials into a BBS, they are the remote
             end of the connection; that users screen is the remote display,
             whatever that user types is remote input.

       RIP - Short for Random Imaging Protocol, this is an emulation that
             requires at least an EGA monitor. It never really caught on,
             but RIP was a 'pretty' emulation, artists drew in the format
             because it allows for clearer (and smaller) pictures than the
             other emulations.
                      
WFC Screen - WFC is short for Waiting For Caller. It's the blue screen with
             all the commands and stats that is seen when Renegade is first
             loaded.
