MCI Codes are display variables. Some change from caller to caller, some
change when the sysop makes a configuration, and some change when a user
does something online. An MCI code represents a piece of information.
When Renegade sees the MCI code, it traslates the code, and displays the
relevant piece of information.

For example:

When I log onto my own system, anywhere the %UN MCI code appears, my handle
will appear instead. Like this;

Handle: %UN

would display as

Handle: Adrian Blood

If we threw in the %RN (Real Name) it'd look like this;

Handle: %UN
Real Name: %RN

to

Handle: Adrian Blood
Real Name: Ken Reaverson

and so on. MCI Codes are a valuable tool to the sysop. Without them, users
wouldn't know which file or message base they were in, how much time they
have left online, or how many file points they have left. :)

                             SPECIAL MCI CODES
&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;

    Some single character MCI codes are used outside of what the remote user
    would see.  These are used in Doors, Protocols, and Archivers, and other
    SPECIAL places.  Here is a list of them:

          %A        Actual Baud Rate
          %B        Baud Rate reported (Locked, if active.)
          %C        Archive Comment (Archivers only)
          %C        Com port hex address (Protocols only)
          %D        Download File List
          %E        Com port IRQ
          %F        File to be processed
          %G        Graphics (0=Off, 1=On)
          %I        Filenames
          %K        Complete name and path of the current file bases's *.DIR
                    file.
          %L        Log file (Protocol)
          %M        Main RG Directory
          %N        Node Number
          %O        Door Drop file for Current Node
          %P        COM Port Number
          %R        Current User's Real Name
          %T        Time Left
          %U        Current User's Handle
          %1        Current User's Real First Name
          %2        Current User's Real Last Name
          %#        User Number

        In ACTIONS.LST ONLY, the following MCI codes are in effect.

          %G        Will display His/Her based on the sender's gender.
          %H        Will display Him/Her based on the sender's gender.

        In QUOTE SECTION OF STRING.DAT ONLY, the following MCI codes are in
        effect.

          @F        User the message is from.
          @T        User the message is to.
          @D        Date of the message.
          @S        Subject of the message.
          @B        Message Base the message was posted on.

        If you want to make sure the MCI code displays properly, you can
        pad and justify it. The command format is like this:

           &lt;MCI&gt;&lt;Justification command&gt;&lt;Length of string&gt;

            ex: %UN#50

            %UN is the MCI Code (User Name)
            # is the justification code (Center)
            50 is the length of the string

            So the above would display the user name in the center of a
            50 character string.

            These are the justification commands:

         # - Centers the MCI in the middle of a string x characters long
             Ex: %UN#50, as above
         { - Left Justifies the MCI code
             Ex: %UN{50, This would display the user name forced to the left,
             padded to 50 characters.
         } - Right Justifies the MCI code
             Ex: %UN}50, This would display the user name forced to the right,
             padded to 50 characters

        Padding limits the amount of characters. For instance, if you pad
        the string to 20, and what would normally show is 25 characters, only
        the first 20 would display.</span></pre>
