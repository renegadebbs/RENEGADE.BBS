--[ Renegade 05-19.4 released ]------------------------------------------------

  |14                        Changes since v01-10.4/DOS

     |11CHANGE -   |03Updated Copyright notice to reflect the new year.

     |11FIXED  -   |03Slight Memory leak in v01-10.4/DOS.  This in turn would
                cause Renegade to eventuatly eat up all availble memory
                in a few years of use if the computer was never rebooted.

     |11ADDED  -   |11/F |03MENUCMD to disable MCI Codes from displaying inside
                of a text file.  This MENUCMD compliments the -F CMD Key.

     |11ADDED  -   |03Option |11/M |03when entering a message to turn on or off
                using MCI Codes per message.

     |11ADDED  -   |03Added option to allow the SysOp access to the amount
                of time to give each timeslice.  This may help some systems
                in which Renegade hogs a lot of CPU (ie: Windows 2000). If
                you do not have much of a problem with sluggish performance
                it is suggested that you leave this option at the default
                setting.

                [System Config -> D. System Variables -> V. Time Slices]

     |11FIXED  -   |03Slight problem when displaying "NEW" bulletins to users
                when they first logon.  Renegade would display 22 of them
                across, then start putting each new one on a new line.

     |11REMOVE -   |03Removed "Digiboard" support in the codebase.  Really,
                who would use one of those now-a-days anyways with a DOS
                based BBS?  If this is an issue for anyone, please e-mail
                us and we'll take care of it for you.

     |11ADDED  -   |03Added option to System Config to post the BBS's telnet
                URL.  This is under System Conifg, Option A Main BBS Config.
                Just a cosmetic add, as before you could only type in a
                telephone number for the BBS.  Now you have a choice. ;)
                Will have to set for each node.  So, node 1 can be
                node1-yourbbs.com and node 2 can be node2-yourbbs.com, etc.
                Or you can set each one to the same url.

     |11ADDED  -   |03Added |11~TN |03MCI Code to BBSME.ASC/ANS and BBSMN.ASC/ANS
                to reflect the new Telnet address line to the BBS list.

     |11CHANGE -   |03Changed the follow command keys to reflect new BBS
                list format change.

                |11OB |03: Changed to CMD Key |11TV|03 {short view of bbslist}
                |11OA |03: Changed to CMD Key |11TA|03 {Add to bbslist}

                |03Added the following CMD Keys to be able to have more
                control over the BBS List.

                |11TA  |03: BBSList Add           {formally CMD Key OA}
                |11TE  |03: BBSList Edit / Remove
                |11TV  |03: BBSList Short View    {formally CMD Key OB}
                |11TX  |03: BBSList Extended View {formally CMD Key OB}

                |03{ Updated |11MENUCMD.ASC |03file to reflect these changes }

     |11CHANGE -   |03BBS Listing is now scriptable.  This means that you
                now can add just about any question for the BBS you wish.
                MCI Codes reflect the different questions (1-8) to display
                when a user views the BBS List.

                |03{ Added |11BBSLIST.SCR |03file to reflect this update }

     |11CHANGE -   |11-TG |03and |11-TS |03command line loaders for Renegade are
                now simply just |11-T |03for all telnet connections.  Unless
                you are using COM/IP as your emulator which the command
                line changed to |11-TC |03(ie: renegade.exe -n4 -tc).

     |11ADDED  -   |11%xA |03/ |11%xB |03/ |11%xC |03/ |11%xD |03/ |11%xE |03/ |11%xF |03for extra definable
                sysop strings in the |11BBSLIST.SCR |03file.

                                |11x|03:= to the following values.
                |11a = 8 chars |03/ |11b = 30 |03/ |11c = 30 |03/ |11d = 40 |03/ |11e = 60 |03/ |11f = 60

                |03Also added %S2 for and extra line of descrition of the
                BBS.  Changed the way it stores the SOFTWARE. It's all
                in capital letters now.  Also, added that if can't find
                |11BBSMN.ASC |03it will echo back that in the sysop log and
                just print out the bbslist.sysopname, etc and proceed.

     |11UPDATE -   |03The Official Renegade Home page is now located at URL:
                              |11http://www.renegadebbs.net

     |11REMOVE -   |03Removed the "Moving xx to xx" from writing to the
                SYSOPx.LOG file.  Saved some clutter there. ;)

     |11FIXED  -   |03The Telnet URL will now save correctly in the
                system config and not constantly erase itself.

     |11CHANGE -   |03Bulletins now compare Time and Date of Files vs Time
                and Date of last logon to display as NEW.

     |11CHANGE -   |11NODE*.ASC |03instead of showning a '|11-|03' when a user isn't
                on a node it will echo back the node number for ~NN, then
                for ~AV it will display 'Y'. MCI Code ~AC is a 20 Chars
                String and ~UN is a 36 character string.

     |11CHANGE -   |03The Caller ID switch is now |11-ID |03instead of just |11-I|03
                Also |11-IP |03puts the IP (if present) into the Caller ID field
                in the User Editor and anything to do with Caller ID.

     |11ADDED  -   |03The String Editor is now removed from Renegade.  All
                strings within the editor are now |11EXTERNAL|03.  We will
                slowly be removing all strings from within Renegade's
                code and making them external for easy editing!  Also
                created DUMP to "dump" the STRING.DAT file to the
                editable language file.

--[ Renegade 01-10.4 released ]------------------------------------------------
  I really need to update this for future people to see.

  1.  FIXED  - Bulletins - Now will correctly display if a bulletin
               is new or not to the user per call and are sorted
               in numerical order.  ie: (2, 7, 19, 22) instead of
               (22, 2, 19, 7).

  2.  ADDED  - (-T, /T) Toggle.  This will inturn toggle all baud
               rate speeds to show as "TELNET".  This also disables
               most comm routines relating to logoffs.  With -T
               added to loading Renegade, it will no longer pause
               for a set number of seconds before the BBS will
               hang the user up.  DO NOT use this command on
               dialup nodes!  Use this on TELNET ONLY NODES!!!!

   3. REVISED  (-T, /T) (-TG, /TG) (-TS, /TS) Load Toggle.
               This will inturn toggle the MCI Code ~SP in
               the last caller ANSI/ASCII to show 'BAUD'.
               (-T, /T) will do the hang-up procedure on a
               regular log-off for COM/IP.  (-TG, /TG) & (-TS, /TS)
               will bypass the passing of the ATH0 hangup string
               to the fossil/com port and will work with GameSrv
               or Synchronet respectivly.  This fix's issues of
               slow hangups while doing a telnet session.
               DO NOT use this command with dialup nodes!

   3. FIXED  - Fixed Toggles Menu and added warning screen about
               the use of certain toggles and what else should be
               changed or certain users may not be able to log
               back on to the BBS.  (ie:  If you have the BBS
               check for birthday's and have the toggle to ask
               for the birthday at new logon set to NO, the user
               will not be able to logon the BBS since he will not
               have a birthday set in the user record.)

   4. FIXED  - Added Time Slice Routines to certain functions in
               Renegade where it awaits for a user input.  This
               SHOULD fix some slow downs while running under
               some version of Windows.

   5. FIXED  - Fixed Memory problems with downloads and swapping
               Renegade out of memory which in turn caused some
               doors not to function.

   6. CHANGE - Changed all file sizes in Renegade to now show as
               Kilobyte (KB), and Megabytes (MB) instead of just
               bytes. (ie: 64,564 bytes NOW DISPLAYS AS 64.5 KB)
               Also changes to the WFC Screen to reflect this.

   7. FIXED  - Fixed upload Limit of 8.1 MB.  Now, will show
               files with sizes up to 1.9 GB.

   8. FIXED  - Fixed the AR, AC Flags [- OF -] toggle command to
               NOT be case sensitive.

   9. ADDED  - MCI Code telnet - This MCI Code shows the users speed,
               ie: Telnet, Local, or Actual Baud Rate.



--[ Renegade 98-101d released ]------------------------------------------------

--[ Renegade 98-120a ]---------------------------------------------------------

  - Included in this update is RGUSRIDX.ZIP. Review the documentation enclosed
    BEFORE installing this update.

  - The "OB" and "OV" cmdkeys have changed (BBSLISTINGS)

    * Bbslistings are still stored in binary format, however, they are now
      sorted in order of phone number entry as they are saved instead of
      using a pointer index.

    * You may now remove entries if your ACS meets the following criteria :
      - You are cosysop or above.
      - The entry was entered by you.

    * The bbslist now uses the permanent index system instead of user numbers.

  - Changed the ~NN mci code to display the node number even if no one is
    currently on that node.

  - Fixes :
      * "NO" cmdkeys didn't work.
      * The bbslist didn't work on large partitions.
      * The timebank and DL-K todays fields could not be edited in the
        user editor.

--[ Renegade 98-139a ]---------------------------------------------------------

  - Removed the "OE" cmdkeys.. If you want to pause a menu, use cmdkeys "-L"
    options "%PA".

  - Removed the "ON" cmdkeys.. If you want to clear screen on a menu, use
    cmdkeys "-L" options "%CL".

  - The bbslist will now read a script file. It should be located in your
    /DATA directory and have the same filename as the bbslist it is
    referring to with the extension of ".TPL". Included is an example of
    how to construct one with your favorite text editor. Color and MCI
    codes "SHOULD" work. (Do not use %DF MCI).
    (Ie... BBSLIST.BBS uses BBSLIST.TPL for a script file).

  - The way the LASTON.DAT works changed completely. It is now completely
    dependant upon the "OL" cmdkeys as to whether or the user is added.

    ACS Req : ""
    Cmdkeys : "OL" <- Creates a LASTON.DAT entry
    Options : [ACS to add to LASTON.DAT]

    "ACS to add to LASTON.DAT" : Specify the ACS the current user must have
                                 to be added to the LASTON.DAT. This may
                                 be any valid ACS. If it is left blank,
                                 all users who meet the cmdkey's ACS Req
                                 setting will be logged to LASTON.DAT.

    ACS Req : ""
    Cmdkeys : "OT"  <- Display LASTON.DAT
    Options : [number of callers to display]<;filename>

    "Number of callers to display" : Displays defined number of callers.
                                     BLANK = All callers shown.

    "Filename" : The filename is optional and works the same way as the
                 old "OL" cmdkeys used to.


  - The OA cmdkeys have changed.

    Was :  Cmdkeys : OA
           Options : [Password];[Validation Key]

    The password was not necessary since you can use the -$ cmdkeys
    to set a validation password for a linked OA cmdkey.

    Now :  Cmdkeys : OA
           Options : [Validation Key]<;[Semaphore To Find]>

    "Validation Key" : This is required for this cmdkey to work.

    "Semaphore To Find" : This is completely optional. If used,
                          Renegade will look for this file and ONLY
                          validate a user if it exists.

                          If you specify a filename only, it's looked
                          for in your /TEMP[node] directory. Otherwise
                          it looks for the full path + filename you
                          specify.

                          Also note: Renegade deletes this file once
                                     found and the user is validated.

  - Fixes :
      * Os2 volume label was treated as a file causing search problems.
      * Bbslisting probems.
      * Moving file attaches in email crapped out.
