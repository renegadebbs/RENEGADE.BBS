Renegade BBS software's history has been rewritten with lies and half truths for many years.

Basically the creator Cott Lang worked on Renegade BBS until 1997. He then handed it over to Patrick Spence and Gary Hall.
Spence could not program, Gary Hall could, apparently.
There were a few releases and drastic changes that most SysOps did not enjoy.  

Programmer Jeff Herrings Created th the Renegade BBS version Y2K, the first
Y2K compliant version of Renegade after contacting Spence and asking if he could contribute. 

Eventually in 2003 Cory Snow took over and did nothing.  He could not program, and he made claims that he would create a java version of Renegade due to copyright issues.

Eventually Cory gave the source to Chris Hoppman and TJ.

(doing a quick history until i fix it up)

I was working on getting sourcecode released from various doorgames and softwares so they would not be lose forever.
I contacted several developers and I was talking all over about it.  Jeff Herrings released the source code and I forwarded it over
to "Jason Scott" of textfiles.com

time passes and I asked programmer rick parrish if he could code a 32bit version of renegade.
Tj sees this as an opportunity to get another ghost programmer to produce work to stamp his name on but Rick didn't bite at the opportunity.

Rick released the first and only 32bit version of renegade to github.

Since then TJ has got several ghost programmers that have done nothing more than make renegade bbs worse.

there are a few people who have taken the source and created linux versions and fixed issues outside of lee palmer or whoever
works on Tj's version of rg.

Renegade BBS is an orphan with no real owner and the history is very unclear.  We don't even know if Cott lang's wishes were followed or if he wanted
the source to be secret and unreleased.  If you take into account the character of these false developers,  you can not believe anything.
